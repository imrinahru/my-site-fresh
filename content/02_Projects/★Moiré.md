**Details → Contour → Oscillation (multi-stability) → Digital–Analog Transition → Automaticity → Aesthetic Rewriting**.

The author uses moiré as a starting point for rethinking analog/digital oscillation not just as a technical property, but as a fundamental aesthetic principle. This back-and-forth between continuous and discrete underlies how media works, how it connects to social and political systems, and how it shapes us as people.

moiré shows how **fluctuations** (oscillations) between discrete (digital) and continuous (analog) processes are _foundational_ to what the author calls **an aesthetics of automaticity**.

- **Automaticity** here refers to the _appearance_ that something is generated automatically, without direct human intervention.
    
- Many image-making techniques—especially technical or mechanical ones—create this sense of “automatic” production.
    
- The author claims that the **functional basis** (locus) of this perceived automaticity is _precisely_ the **oscillation between digital and analog**:
    
    - For example, in printing, photography, or digital imaging, discrete units (pixels, halftone dots) combine to produce a continuous image—this back-and-forth gives the sense of a machine doing the work.

- They invoke **Bernhard Siegert’s** concept of _cultural techniques_—foundational, historically developed practices (like writing, mapping, numbering) that shape culture and thought.
    
- In the **Western technical tradition**, the **grid** is one such cultural technique:
    
    - It structures how space is represented (in art, architecture, printing, photography, computer graphics).
        
    - Moiré patterns often emerge from _interactions of grids_ (e.g., overlapping pixel arrays, screen meshes).
        
- So moiré is rooted in the **specific history** of Western media’s reliance on grids.

- Even though moiré is tied to the Western tradition of the grid, it **also undermines** that tradition:
    
    - Moiré patterns are _unpredictable_ and _destabilize_ the clean order of the grid.
        
    - They can appear anywhere overlapping structures exist—not just in Western-designed systems.
        
- Therefore, moiré doesn’t just reflect a _Western_ history—it also **indexes (points toward)** a more universal **aesthetics of technicity**:
    
    - **Technicity** = the aesthetic and experiential qualities that arise from technical processes themselves.


The profound difference between the hand-drawn and the photographic, I argue, does not have to do with a distinction between human presence or absence, but between the eye and the lens, or between the manual and the mechanical. Rather, it has to do with distinctions between repeatability and variability, rigidity and flexibility, stasis and dynamism. It has to do, most precisely, with the relative presence or absence of dynamic feedback within the image-making process.

- - Moiré disrupts the common idea of images as purely _contents of perception_ (i.e., something you “see” without thinking about how it’s made).
        
    - This opens the door to a **medial** (media-specific) definition of _texture_ as an **aesthetic concept**—one that raises questions about **how automaticity is mediated** (how technical systems shape the way we perceive something as “automatic”).
        
- They bring in **Laura Marks** and her concept of _haptic visuality_:
    
    - This is vision understood as _sensory contact_, not detached observation.
        
    - Marks argues that European post-Enlightenment rationality shifted vision away from this “contact” model toward a disembodied, knowledge-centric model.

self-negating diaphragm exemplifies the _diaphanous_ function of media, first formalized as a medial concept by Aristotle, and of which Sybille Krämer reminds us: “transparency (the diaphanous) . . . is an early thematization of the phenomenon of medial self-neutralization . . . The interrelationship between ‘making something appear’ and ‘withdrawing oneself’ provides a criterion that distinguishes media from related phenomena.”undefined As she states elsewhere, this diaphanous quality is a _functional_ characteristic of media, not an essential quality, and thus its transparency is “an attribute of media performance_._”

Oster would discuss the effect’s many facets: its status as a perceptual phenomenon, its scientific utility as a measurement device, and even its ability to function as an analog computer.

In addition to its art historical breadth, see, for a detailed engagement with Oster, Arnauld Pierre, _Magic moirés: Gerald Oster et l’art des moirages_ (Éditions Macula, 2022).

the 1970 short film _Moirage_ by Stan VanDerBeek and Gerry Oster, the “vibratory” sculpture of Venezuelan-German artist Gego, the concrete poetry of Henri Chopin, the mail art of Ruth Wolf-Rehfeldt, the earliest instances of computationally generated images, pieces by contemporary artists such as Nicholas Sassoon and Rosha Yaghmai, and many more. This list could, of course, be greatly extended. For an art historical account of moiré patterns which provides a wonderful collection of artists throughout the 20th century who have employed the moiré effect, see Arnauld Pierre, _Magic moirés_.


The origin of the moiré effect is therefore not visual, but rather haptic. If the generalized effect refers, as we have already noted, to the visual overlap of very similar patterns, we find that, at its origin, the effect is produced through the physical interaction between two layers of silk.

A genuinely capacious aesthetics must appreciate the sensory interactions not just between _human_ sensing and the world, but indeed those which exist between layers of technical systems.

- Using Simondon’s framework, a moiré image isn’t just the shimmering lines you _see_—it also includes:
    
    - The material setup (silk weave, overlapping threads),
        
    - The optical conditions (light, angle of view),
        
    - The perceptual/cognitive patterns that allow you to recognize it.
        
- This “intra-perceptual image” also connects to **social meaning**—it’s not only private perception but tied to collective memory and cultural associations.

Silver starts by tying texture to the philosophical concept of **emergence**:

- **Emergence**: when new, complex properties appear from the combination of simple elements.
    
    - Modern phrasing: complexity from simplicity.
        
    - 17th-century phrasing: the varied forms and qualities of the world can be explained through the arrangement of simple particles with almost no inherent qualities.
        
- Key point: these new properties **cannot be reduced** to the properties of the parts—they are qualitatively new.

Silver says texture mediates between **two otherwise incommensurable ways** of knowing something:

1. **Pragmatic aspect**
    
    - Concerned with **material properties**: the physical makeup, measurable qualities, and structural factors of a substance.
        
    - Objective and analytical—linked to the world as matter.
        
2. **Phenomenological aspect**
    
    - Concerned with the **impression** or felt experience of the material.
        
    - It “wraps” the awareness of material interiors into an immediate sensory impression.
        
    - This is the lived, embodied experience of texture.

By connecting these two registers, texture becomes **productive**:

- It’s not just a property of objects—it’s a **way of experiencing the world**.
    
- It happens **in the immediacy of contact**—what Silver calls a “contact zone.”
    
- Texture is “one of ingrained interiors” — meaning that the experience is tied to the internal structure of materials as they are felt or perceived directly.
- Silver, “The Emergence of Texture,” 172.

Silver’s account roots the inventiveness of texture in **weaving**:

- Weaving is a practice that inherently combines:
    
    - **Materiality** (threads, fibers, physical structure),
        
    - **Sensory experience** (tactile feel, visual patterns),
        
    - **Symbolic meaning** (status, cultural identity, design language).
        
- Weaving thus serves as both a literal and metaphorical foundation for understanding texture as a mediating, inventive force.

- This links texture to **automaticity** — the sense that an image or pattern seems to arise **without direct human intervention**.
    
- In weaving, patterns often emerge from the technical setup itself (loom mechanics, thread crossings) rather than being individually hand-drawn or painted.
    
- This automaticity is _perceived_, meaning it’s a **cultural and sensory experience** as much as a technical fact.

- - **an automatic image** → it arises from technical/material interactions, without needing a hand-crafted design.
        
- This automatic image is **inventive** and **interferential** — it comes from the _interference patterns_ produced when two regular structures (like woven threads) overlap.
  
> Thus, in texture, we find the first expression of an aesthetic concept which is rooted in the haptic feedback of textiles and perceptually thematized by watered silk, but which is broadly applicable to any process which seems to mediate, “automatically” through serial repetition on one level and wholistic perception on another, a relationship between strata of technical and perceptual sensibility.

- - moiré patterns show a **paradox**:
        
        - **Rote repetition**: mechanical, identical, discrete elements (digital).
            
        - **Generativity**: new, unexpected forms emerging _because_ of repetition (analog-like continuity or novelty in perception).

- This paradox is embodied in textiles:
    
    - **Individual threads** = discrete, countable units.
        
    - **Cumulative overlap** = continuous shimmering pattern perceived by the viewer.
        
- The moiré effect sits _between_ these two — it emerges from discrete multiplicity but is experienced as analog flow.

Galloway refines “the multiple” into two types:

1. **Formal multiplicity**:
    
    - Duplication or copying that leaves the original intact.
        
    - Example: reproducing an image without altering it.
        
    - Concern here might be the _uncanny_ sense of copies, but the copy doesn’t change the nature of the original.
        
2. **Real multiplicity**:
    
    - The multiplicity that is **material** to digital computation.
        
    - Units like monads, sets, arrays, molecules, cells, crystals — discrete building blocks that form the basis of larger systems.
        
    - Here, multiplicity is intrinsic to the medium itself, not just an act of duplication.

- Discrete warp/weft threads (digital multiple) are systematized in a regular grid.
    
- Overlaps between grids produce interference patterns that create _continuous_ visual effects (analog).
    
- This is the **oscillation**: the viewer experiences both the underlying discrete order and the emergent continuous shimmer.

**Friedrich Kittler’s “technological a priori”**:

- The underlying technical conditions that shape what can be thought, expressed, and perceived in a given historical moment.
    
- The author says the dominance of the multiple is _contingent_ — it’s the outcome of specific historical and political developments, not an eternal truth.

- The multiple isn’t just about **copying** (e.g., printing press, photography producing indistinguishable reproductions).
    
- Instead, it’s about a **transductive capacity**:
    
    - **Transduction** (Simondon’s term) = a process where one form of activity transforms into another, carrying structural changes across domains.
        
    - Here: repetition isn’t static — it can transform from being a _figure of order_ into a _ground for novelty_.
        
        - **Figure of technological ordering**: the grid, the frame, the code that organizes.
            
        - **Ground for something novel**: unexpected emergent effects, like moiré shimmer.

- When this shift is seen as a **complete process**, it’s what the author calls **technical automaticity**:
    
    - The capacity of a technical system to produce something perceptually or materially new out of ordered repetition, without direct creative intervention.

- The multiple is not just _part_ of digitality — it’s a **second-order phenomenon**:
    
    - **First-order digitality**: discrete units, binary logic, modular components.
        
    - **Second-order (the multiple)**: how those units, when systematized, can enable new capacities — things the raw discreteness alone doesn’t produce.
        
- In other words, the multiple both:
    
    1. **Accesses** the base capacities of the digital (countability, repetition, discreteness), and
        
    2. **Extends** them into new realms (emergence, novelty, complexity).

- - **Duck-rabbit illusion** – the contour stays, but its meaning flips.
        
    - **Necker cube** – the edges remain, but depth orientation alternates.
        
- In such moments, the contour is **reconstituted and broken again**, showing the oscillatory nature of perception.

- Like a contour, it’s a **“republic of details”**: many small elements create a coherent perceived form.
    
- In moiré, **high-frequency digital processes** (fine patterns) become perceived as **analog contours** (larger-scale patterns).
    
- This illustrates the **transition** between digital (discrete, small-scale) and analog (continuous, large-scale) modes in perception.

- This perspective:
    
    - Cuts across boundaries between art, science, technology, perception, and media.
        
    - Uses moiré patterns as a persistent reminder of the **artifact**—the visible, structural residue—within automatic images.
        
- The takeaway: by focusing on the **moment of oscillation** between digital and analog, one can **analyze** and **reshape** how media processes like copying, generating, or reproducing work.

As the moiré effect presents itself as a content of perception and becomes iconic, in other words, an _analog_ transformation occurs: “Analog coding leading to iconic gestalts selected by the perceiver is the basis of body communication between humans . . . Iconic communication in general includes sculpture, music, painting, photography, film, and video. Along with visual icons (the commonest kind) should be included images of touch, taste, smell, and hearing, and icons of orientation in space and time.”
Anthony Wilden, _The Rules Are No Game: The Strategy of Communication_ (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1987).
## Digital = Analog

Moiré patterns (like the wavy lines when grids overlap) **occur in many media**—TV, textiles, scanned PDFs, digital cameras. They are **not just visual noise** but **evidence** of how analog and digital processes meet and produce emergent effects.

 **Digital vs. Analog: Not a Binary, but an Oscillation**

- Digital = discrete, countable, repeatable (e.g., pixels, threads, tokens).
    
- Analog = continuous, flowing, perceptual (e.g., visual contours, shimmering textures).

**Moiré effects emerge in the oscillation between the two**—neither purely digital nor analog. This oscillation is framed as **an aesthetic operation**, not just a technical glitch.

In the same sense, texture (weaving) is connected to the **emergence of form and sensation**. It is not just felt—it is how **micro-patterns** (e.g. threads or pixels) become **macro-impressions** (e.g. shimmer or interference). Texture mediates between systems: craft and computation, sight and touch, form and process.

Images don’t just exist in perception—they’re **formed through interactions between body, media, and world.** Moiré appears unbidden, but its emergence **tells us something deep** about how machines and humans co-produce sense.

Even though shimmer looks magical or decorative, it actually **reveals** how things are built—whether it's textile machinery, camera technology, or even plant biology.  
It’s a **cultural clue**, not just a visual effect.

- **Calender**: a machine that presses fabric like silk to make moiré—so the shimmer comes from **pressure patterns in threads**.
    
- **CCD (Charge-Coupled Device)**: part of a digital camera sensor—a grid of light-sensitive elements. If it interferes with a patterned surface, you get digital moiré.
    
- **Viral lattice in a tulip**: During **Tulip Mania**, tulips infected with a virus (called a “mosaic virus”) had unique flame-like streaks. Those streaks are caused by **virus-induced molecular changes**, like a hidden “biological grid.”

> Moire patterns are nowhere more fa miliar in daily life than they are in Japan. They appear not only in moire silks (which were made in the Orient long before they were known in France) but also in two-ply summer kimonos, the pattern of which shimmers with the movements of the wearer, in woven baskets and in the overlapping layers of half-raised bamboo blinds. 

> The only gen eral requirement for a moire pattern is that the interacting figures have some sort of solid and open regions. The solid regions can be lines (straight, curved or wiggly), dots or any other geometric form. 
In the typical moire pattern the moire effect materializes when two sets of straight lines are superposed so that they intersect at a small angle. If the super posed lines are nearly parallel, a tiny displacement of one of the figures will give rise to a large displacement in the elements of the moire pattern. In other words, the displacement is magnified. 

A moire patter n can be regarded as the mathematical solution to the inter ference of two periodic functions; hence the moire technique can be used as an analogue computer. When line figures representing periodic functions are moved about in a continuous manner,
