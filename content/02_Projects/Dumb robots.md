## Goal  
Describe the change this project aims to create.

Create a robot that works to clean up children's room. The robot is very simple and dumb. It just detects things/walls and decide to turn right or left, in doing so, it pushes children's gadgets to a few piles. When children comes nearer to the robot, it detects and cling to the floor. It has to detach itself from the floor once the children are left.
