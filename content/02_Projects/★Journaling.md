## Goal  
Describe the change this project aims to create.


## How

The first month, normal journaling, starting from August 1st.
The second month, provide short prompt including facts and feelings to AI, generate journal entry. Modify with AI until satisfactory. How do you feel? Is the feeling recuperated?
The third month, provide short prompt on the event, but omit subjectivity. Modify with AI to the point the facts are correct. How do you feel? Is the feeling recuperated?
The fourth month, let AI generate daily journal (with web search), and infer from my past entry.
