# Reading Notes: Benjamin Bratton, “On Speculative Design” (DIS Magazine)


https://dismagazine.com/discussion/81971/on-speculative-design-benjamin-h-bratton/


## 1. The Material Turn in Design

**Design’s new materials**

- The real value of emerging materials lies not only in what we can make with them, but in how they force us to revisit fundamental questions about identity, location, and being.
    

**Material culture and pathology**

- Design often serves to make our **pathological relationships to material culture** more efficient and delightful — worsening the condition it might seek to improve.
    

**Materialism as origin of design**

- To mobilize Speculative Design (SD) toward not-yet-existing conditions, we must return to the **actual matter** of materialism.
    
- Design practice is interested in what can be done with materials.
    
- Speculative Design is interested in what materials reveal about being human.

## 2. Design as Speculation

**Predictive vs. Speculative Models**

- Predictive models are _descriptive_ and adaptive.
    
- Speculative models are _prescriptive_ and normative — they imagine possible futures.
    
- Between them lie key concepts: contingency, simulation, resistance, universality, neutrality, etc.
    
- Here, Design becomes **designation** — it names and frames possible worlds.
    

**Beyond Futurity**

- SD resist or eliminate “futurity” as its focus, shifting instead toward **immediate spatial and temporal contexts**, designing for the “here and now.”
    

**Scales of Futurity**

- Bratton outlines several overlapping temporalities:
    
    - **Social future** (fashion cycles, communal memory)
        
    - **Technical future** (product and mechanical evolution)
        
    - **Historical future** (friend/enemy relations, cultural memory)
        
    - **Geologic future** (planetary rhythms beyond human life)

## 3. Domains of Speculative Design

|Domain|Central Concern|Core Speculative Question|
|---|---|---|
|Human–AI Interaction|Empathy and identity in synthetic life|How will we guide AI’s evolution as part of the living world?|
|Ubiquitous Computation|Digital–physical continuum|How do representation and reality merge?|
|Synthetic Biology|Programmable life|Will biology become code, or code become life?|
|Epidermal Sensors|Blurred boundary of body and world|What is the new “skin” of communication?|
|Machine Vision|AI perception and aesthetics|How do machines _see_ us differently?|
|Human Hand & Mobile Device|Embodied technology use|How do our bodies evolve with our tools?|
|High-Res Sensing & Fabrication|Material precision and planetary design|How do new material capabilities reshape culture and society?|

---

## 4. Cultural and Technological Acceleration

- **Autonomous traditions** (slow-evolving, rooted practices) are accelerated by technological change.
    
- Everyday urbanism becomes **modular and adaptive**, like the International Space Station, reconfigurable, scalable, and interdependent.
    
- The **history of design** is also the history of new modeling practices — from GUIs to big data — that shape what we imagine can be made.
    

**Quotes for reflection**

> “Sometimes you build a kite and it evolves into 4Chan.”  
> “Emerging technologies are developing faster than our conceptual frameworks can orient them.”  
> “Our current thinking both enables and limits meaningful innovation.”  
> “Maximizing engineering while neglecting critical design thinking is irrational.”

---

## 5. Ethics and Ambiguity in Speculative Design

**Ambivalence as strength**

- The more a project makes you uncertain — utopian or horrifying, cure or poison — the more valuable it is.
    
- Ambiguity, abstraction, and ambivalence are **signs of success**, not failure.
    
- If the ethical answer is obvious, the project is too simple.
    

**Speculative vs. Regular Design**

- Regular design solves practical problems.
    
- Speculative design provokes reflection and challenges assumptions.
    
- Its goal is **productive ambiguity**, not clarity or usability.

## 6. Beyond Human-Centered Design

- “Human-centered design” may itself be part of the problem.
    
- The crisis of the Anthropocene reveals the limits of **anthropocentrism** — a worldview that places humans at the center.
    
- Moving forward requires **decentering the human**: understanding humanity as one form of life and matter among many.
    

> To conclude: What is called “human-centered design” (sometimes interchangeable with “User-Centered Design”) is not only not the solution, it is quite often the problem.
> The interest, to be clear, is not to eliminate (or to claim to eliminate) human sentience, sapience and affect from these rich dramas, but to conceptualize the world and to compose with it according to models that locate human specificity in a more deliberately dispassionate position.

> “Design scaled to the scope of the real, not reality downsampled toward the digestible.”

**Comment:**  
Reorienting toward posthuman or planetary design requires new ethical frameworks — perhaps feminist or relational — that can absorb the personal sacrifices implied by long-term, collective futures.

# Reading Notes: Matteo Pasquinelli, “Three Thousand Years of Algorithmic Rituals”


## 1. Genealogy of the Algorithm

- Algorithms are **ancient material practices**, not modern abstractions.
    
- They originated from **rituals, routines, and spatial organization** — long before machines or mathematics.
    
- To “compute” has always meant to act for someone: institutions, markets, armies.
    

**Key point:**

> Algorithms emerged from divisions of **space, time, labor, and social relations** — they are material before they are mathematical.

---

## 2. From Ritual to AI

- Ancient rituals (like the **Agnicayana** fire altar) already encoded spatial and procedural computation.
    
- Early neural networks (the **Perceptron**) and modern **self-driving vehicles** share this logic of patterned space and recognition. 

- All three involve **spatial organization and pattern recognition** — they are _different forms of algorithmic or computational logic_.


>  Now that they are preparing the way for the automation of perception, for the innovation of artificial vision, delegating the analysis of objective reality to a machine, it might be appropriate to have another look at the nature of the virtual image

**Virilio’s warning:**  
The “industrialization of vision” delegates perception to machines — creating an age of **sightless vision**, where objects and systems perceive us.

---

## 3. Computational Space and Self-Organization


>  Cognition cannot be completely disentangled from a spatial logic, and often follows a spatial logic in its more abstract constructions.

 >  **AI imitates, replaces, and emerges from an _organized division of social space_ (according first to a material algorithm and not the application of mathematical formulas or analysis in the abstract).**




- AI and neural networks embody a **topological logic** — information as spatial and active, not passive.
    
- Early “computational geometry” and postwar **cybernetics** (von Neumann, Zuse) linked algorithms to **self-organizing systems**.
    

**Universal Approximation Theorem:**  
Neural networks can approximate any pattern — but this universality is built on **collective labor and data**, not pure abstraction.


---

## 4. Labor, Logic, and Collective Intelligence

- The rise of AI automation paradoxically reveals that **labor is cognitive**.
    
- Algorithms crystallize **collective human intelligence** into **privatized computational forms**.
    
- Just as industrial machines emerged from manual skill, AI emerges from **data generated by collective social activity**.
    

**AI as imitation engine**

> “AI imitates, replaces, and emerges from an organized division of social space.”

AI does not simply simulate intelligence — it **captures and automates** patterns of labor, cognition, and collective behavior.

---

## 5. The Algorithm as Emergent Form


>“Perhaps these different spatial logics together can clarify the algorithm as an emergent form rather than a technological a priori.”

- The **algorithm** shouldn’t be seen as something purely technical or modern (“technological a priori”).
    
- ==Instead, it is an **emergent pattern** — something that develops _through practice, repetition, and spatial organization_ across human and machine systems.==
    
- From ancient rituals to AI, algorithms emerge wherever there’s a ==**structured repetition of actions** that produce order or meaning==.

- Machine learning continues this lineage, translating collective and spatial logics into automated systems.

### Lovink, Geert.

**“After the Social Media Hype: Dealing with Information Overload”** (e-flux Journal, 2013)  
**and**  
**“What Is the Social in Social Media?”** (e-flux Journal, 2012)  
[https://www.e-flux.com/journal/45/60109/after-the-social-media-hype-dealing-with-information-overload](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/45/60109/after-the-social-media-hype-dealing-with-information-overload)


>  So Google still can’t be evil. Suspicion about the business model of internet start-ups will not and cannot arise. We use technology, they say, in order to “thrive.” In this positivist view, our will is strong enough to “bend” the machines in such a way that they will eventually start working for us—and not the other way around. If we as conscious citizen-consumers flock together, the business community will follow suit. There is no Facebook conspiracy (for instance their collaboration with the CIA) as we are Facebook. We are its employees, investors, first adoptors, app developers, social media marketers—in short, propagandists of a cause we do not understand. It is the technology that is disruptive, not those who complain about it. Those who unwittingly support the malignant social media cause which they naively believe to be a force for good are kept busy thinking they have signed up for a self-improvement course. The user is too busy “thriving” with the constant streams of tweets, status updates, pings, and emails, until it is time for the next gadget.

>  Sloterdijk’s emphasis on exercises and repetition, combined with Richard Sennett’s argument (in _The Craftman_ [2009]) in favor of skills, help us to focus on tools (such as the diary) that we can use to set goals in the morning and reflect in the evening on the improvements that we made during the day. However, the disruptive nature of real-time news and social media needs to find a place in this model. In the meantime, Sloterdijk remains ambivalent about the use of information technology.


#### Main Argument

Lovink critiques the utopian belief that technology inherently empowers individuals. Instead, he argues that social media users have become the labor force and propagandists of platforms they believe serve them, when in fact they sustain corporate and algorithmic power.

#### Key Points

- **Myth of benevolent technology:** The dominant narrative claims we can “bend” machines to serve human needs. This belief masks the structural asymmetry between users and platforms.
    
- **Illusion of participation:** There is “no Facebook conspiracy” because _we are Facebook_—as users, marketers, and developers, we collectively sustain its operations and ideology.
    
- **Self-optimization and distraction:** The user’s drive to “thrive” through constant connectivity produces exhaustion rather than empowerment, trapping individuals in cycles of self-improvement mediated by technological consumption.
    
- **Philosophical framing:** Drawing on Sloterdijk and Sennett, Lovink points to the need for _discipline and reflection_—daily exercises of attention and self-awareness—to resist the fragmentation caused by real-time information flows. Yet, Sloterdijk remains ambivalent toward information technology, leaving open the question of whether such practices can coexist with digital immediacy.

### Galloway, Alexander R., and Eugene Thacker.

**“Protocol, Control, and Networks.”** _Grey Room_ 17 (Fall 2004): 6–29.

>  we identify in the current literature a general willingness to ignore politics by masking it inside the so-called black box of technology.

>  What is needed, then, is an analysis of networks not at the broad level of political theory but at the microtechnical level of nonhuman, machinic practices. To this end, the principle of political control we suggest is most helpful for thinking about technological networks as protocol, a word derived from computer science but which resonates in the life sciences as well

>  The question we aim to explore here is What is the principle of political organization or control that stitches a network together? Writers like Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have helped answer this question in the sociopolitical sphere. They describe the global principle of political organization as one of "Empire."
#### Main Argument

Galloway and Thacker argue that political power in networked societies operates through **protocol**—the technical and procedural rules that govern digital communication. To understand control today, one must analyze the microtechnical mechanisms through which networks function, not just their political or economic effects.

#### Key Points

- **Politics in the black box:** Contemporary discourse often conceals politics within the “black box” of technology, avoiding the material and procedural operations that actually produce power.
    
- **Protocol as control:** Borrowed from computer science, _protocol_ describes the rules that determine how data flows and connections are maintained. This technical structure itself is a form of political organization.
    
- **Microtechnical analysis:** Understanding networks requires studying how nonhuman, machinic practices—such as code, standards, and data formats—enforce order and discipline.
    
- **Relation to Empire:** Drawing from Hardt and Negri, Galloway and Thacker suggest that protocol serves as the infrastructural logic of the global “Empire”—a decentralized, distributed form of control characteristic of contemporary capitalism.

### Thematic Connection

Both Lovink and Galloway/Thacker interrogate **how control manifests through technology**:

- Lovink exposes the _psychological and cultural_ dimensions of voluntary participation in digital systems.
    
- Galloway and Thacker theorize the _technical and structural_ mechanisms that encode political power into networks.  
    Together, they reveal that digital control operates not through coercion but through **participation, automation, and protocol**, blurring the line between empowerment and subjugation.
