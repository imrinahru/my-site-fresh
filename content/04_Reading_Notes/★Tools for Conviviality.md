### Introduction

Ivan Illich’s _Tools for Conviviality_ argues that modern industrial institutions and technologies have outgrown the human scale. As tools become more powerful and interdependent, they no longer extend freedom; they condition people to serve the system. Re‑establishing “conviviality” means redesigning tools and institutions so that everyone can act autonomously, cooperate, and shape their own environment.

### 1. Convivial Tools vs. Manipulative Systems

- **Convivial tools** can be used easily and freely, as often or as seldom as the user desires. Their use by one person does not restrict others, and they do not impose an obligation to use them.
    
- **Manipulative (industrial) tools** create their own demand, require professional control, and shape users to fit a centralized system. They transform needs into commodities, replacing personal agency with programmed consumption.
    

---

### 2. Historical Drift from Hand Tools to Mega‑Machines

Pre‑industrial societies relied on human or animal energy and simple devices. Modern engines, bureaucracies, and digital networks decouple energy and decision‑making from the user, creating “mega‑machines” that treat humans as interchangeable operators. The result is systemic rather than personal domination: no single master wields the whip, yet the machinery disciplines everyone.

---

### 3. A Typology of Human Activity

|Mode|Experience|Market Logic|Typical Tools|Access Mechanism|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Work**|Creative, self‑directed|Only results are sold|Hand tools, craft media|Open skills|
|**Labor**|Repetitive, survival‑oriented|Activity itself is waged|Factory machinery|Employment contracts|
|**Operation**|System‑bound, procedural|Access follows prior consumption (credentials)|Complex technological systems, digital platforms|Licences, degrees|

Illich shows how industrial expansion pushes society from “work” toward “operation,” narrowing the space for autonomy.

---

### 4. Radical Monopoly

When a single class of industrial tools becomes the _only_ socially recognized way to meet a basic need, it enjoys a radical monopoly. Cars redefine mobility, schools redefine learning, hospitals redefine care. Alternative, simpler practices are first marginalized, then rendered impossible by zoning, licensing, or sheer cost.

---

### 5. Overprogramming, Education, and Scarcity of Learning

As institutions grow, they require ever tighter programming of behavior. Schooling—originally rare and optional—turns into compulsory preparation for life inside large systems. Genuine learning (self‑initiated, context‑specific) shrinks, while the expense of formal education rises faster than its social return, producing layers of “dropouts” and reinforcing class stratification.

---

### 6. Justice and Political Process

Illich replaces the question _“Who owns the means of production?”_ with _“What kinds of tools shall exist at all?”_  
A convivial politics would:

1. **Set constitutional limits** on scale, speed, and complexity to keep technology within human control.
    
2. **Guard distributive and participatory justice**, ensuring no one’s freedom to act requires the enforced labor, learning, or consumption of another.
    
3. **Use counterfoil research**—public, comparative studies that reveal when tool systems cross the threshold from useful to oppressive.
    

---

### 7. Ecological and Social Limits

Unchecked industrial growth erodes the physical environment, saturates people with compulsory consumption, and fragments communities. True ecological correction demands _less_ total throughput, not merely “cleaner” throughput; otherwise pollution is only displaced or delayed, and social disintegration deepens.

---

### 8. Redefining Liberty

Both capitalist consumerism and central‑planning socialism mistake liberty for unlimited access to ever more powerful tools. Real freedom lies in collectively agreed limits that preserve room for personal initiative, shared traditions, and diverse life‑ways.

---

### 9. Implications for Contemporary Technology and AI

Illich’s lens clarifies current debates on AI commons:

- Large‑scale, closed AI platforms risk becoming radical monopolies that dictate how society thinks, learns, and transacts.
    
- A convivial AI ecosystem would favor open models, community‑run compute, and interfaces that users can inspect, modify, and repurpose—extending intelligence without displacing it.

### 10. Toward a Convivial Society

Progress need not mean bigger or faster; it can mean _deeper_: richer relationships, more meaningful work, and technologies scaled to enhance rather than eclipse human capacities. Achieving this requires:

1. **Widespread recognition** of the crisis of scale.
    
2. **Grass‑roots movements** that practice voluntary simplicity and mutual aid.
    
3. **Legal and procedural reforms** that empower communities to set and enforce tool limits.



















> *Men with industrially distorted minds cannot grasp the rich texture of personal accomplishments within the range of modern though limited tools.*
### Notes  
- Illich's observation applies to school, medical, and transportation, that when the complexity, professionalism, and centralization of the domain exceeds a certain natural _limit_, it enslaves people by adding great cost to the whole society, while only a few can benefit from the result.
- More is not better. Progress is not the solution.
- We need tools that work _with_ us, that enhance people's freedom, that bring out our energy and imagination.
- New politics would aim principally to exclude the design of artifacts and rules that are obstacles to the exercise of this personal freedom
- Values fundamental to convivial society
	- survival: conditions for survival
	- justice: conditions for the just distribution of industrial outputs
	- self-defined work: no one person’s ability to express him- or herself in work will require as a condition the enforced labor or the enforced learning or the enforced consumption of another.
- This political process will find its concrete expression in a series of temporary agreements on one or the other _concrete limitation of means_, constantly adjusted under the pressure of conflicting insights and interests.
- The progressive homogenization of personalities and personal relationships cannot be stemmed without a retooling of society. A pluralism of limited tools and of convivial commonweals would of necessity encourage a diversity of life styles.
- Management can be done away with only by eliminating the machinery that makes it necessary and, therefore, the demands for output that give it sway.
- A methodology by which to recognize when corporate tools become destructive of society itself requires the recognition of the value of distributory and participatory justice. I believe that my succinct statement will be sufficient to identify necessary restraints on tools, but it will also preclude that in this essay I reach any conclusion about a desirable degree of subordination of means to ends.
- Question the industrially determined shape of our expectations. Only then can we recognize that the emergence of a convivial and pluralist mode of production will follow the limitation of industrial institutions.
- A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others.
- People feel joy, as opposed to mere pleasure, to the extent that their activities are creative; while the growth of tools beyond a certain point increases regimentation, dependence, exploitation, and impotence.
- I use this term (tool) because it allows me to subsume into one category all rationally designed devices, be they artifacts or rules, codes or operators, and to distinguish all these planned and engineered instrumentalities from other things such as basic food or implements, which in a given culture are not deemed to be subject to rationalization.
- Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning and expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a convivial fashion.

Hand tools are those which adapt man’s metabolic energy to a specific task. 
Power tools are moved, at least partially, by energy converted outside the human body. Some of them act as amplifiers of human energy: the oxen pull the plow, but man works with the oxen - the result is obtained by pooling the powers of beast and man. 
On the other hand, the energy used to steer a jet plane has ceased to be a significant fraction of its power output. The pilot is reduced to a mere operator guided by data which a computer digests for him. The machine needs him for lack of a better computer; or he is in the cockpit because the social control of unions over airplanes imposes his presence.

> Tools foster conviviality to the extent to which they can be easily used, by anybody, as often or as seldom as desired, for the accomplishment of a purpose chosen by the user. The use of such tools by one person does not restrain another from using them equally. They do not require previous certification of the user. Their existence does not impose any obligation to use them. They allow the user to express his meaning in action.


In principle the distinction between convivial and manipulatory tools is independent of the level of technology of the tool. What has been said of the telephone could be repeated point by point for the mails or for a typical Mexican market. Each is an institutional arrangement that maximizes liberty, even though in a broader context it can be abused for purposes of manipulation and control. 

## Second watershed

- the infrastructure of roles, systems, and bureaucracies (e.g. certifications, policies, administrative overhead) now **costs more than the actual human activity** (like a person simply teaching another person).
- creates **interdependent tool systems** that exclude people who lack access to **any one** part of the system.
- Simpler, **more human-scale tools** or ways of doing things—like writing thoughtful letters (civilized correspondence)—get **eliminated** because they don’t fit into the high-efficiency, high-cost system.
- As a tool or institution **grows in power**, it tends to **eliminate competition**.

## A balance

**a flexible balance** between:

- **Distributive justice** (fair distribution of goods/services)
    
- **Participatory justice** (freedom to act, build, contribute)

A convivial society doesn’t have to **eliminate** manipulative tools or addictive services completely.

Instead, it must **balance**:

1. **Manipulative/specialized tools**  
    Tools that **create demand** for themselves (e.g., mass media, planned obsolescence, factory schooling).  
    These **shape users to fit the system** rather than letting them act freely.
    
2. **Complementary/enabling tools**  
    Tools that **foster self-realization**, letting people pursue goals **on their own terms** (e.g., bicycles, libraries, community workshops).  
    These tools are **adaptable**, **accessible**, and **non-coercive**.

Abstract Production vs. Personal Fulfillment
- **Manipulative tools**: Designed to meet generalized, planned needs—like systems that mass-produce education or health according to standardized models.
    
- **Convivial tools**: Support people in **pursuing unique, personal goals**, based on their own context, creativity, and desire.

## Ownership ≠ Control

warns against the illusion that **switching from private to public ownership** (e.g. nationalizing factories or services) would **solve the problem**. This is a **false solution** if the tools themselves are **inherently uncontrollable** or **manipulative**.

Human metabolism provided the energy that powered classical agriculture, manufacture, and war.

Men knew how to harness some of the forces of the environment.

A large portion of the lifetime capacity of a man to act on his physical and social environment is burnt running around while he grows up. More is spent for chores that lie beyond his personal choice - but also beyond other men’s reach. 

Because energy came from people (and animals), **social dominance required interpersonal authority**. There was no way to **bypass people** through machines or energy systems.


- Today, one person (or corporation) can **control massive amounts of energy or production** without needing to command many people.
    
- This is because modern tools (engines, servers, bureaucracies) act as **force multipliers**, operating **independently of direct human effort**.
    
- That leads to **asymmetric power**—and a kind of control **no longer based on personal authority**, but on **access to abstract systems**.


## Historical observation
**Even before industrialization**, the seeds of alienation and domination were planted—not just through tools, but through **the power dynamics enabled by surplus production** and cultural legitimation.

**Equality of means ≠ Equality of outcomes**

lich points out that while **everyone may have had roughly the same physical access to tools and power sources** (like muscle, animals, or simple hand tools), this **didn’t mean true equality**.

- One person’s **greater physical strength** could still dominate others.
    
- Slight **technological or organizational advantages** (like better weapons or strategy) could make **one group dominant** over another.

**Tools and Resources Create Class Societies**

**Excess Energy = Political Control Opportunity**
- nce people produced **more than they needed**, that **“excess power”** became available for **others to control**.**Taxation** (taking a portion of the output), **Forced labor or slavery**, **Tribute systems**.

Illich highlights that **it’s not just coercion** that maintains inequality—**culture and belief** play a major role.

- People often **internalize** class roles as “natural” or “sacred.”
    
- **Social systems** (like caste, aristocracy, religious hierarchies) are **shaped by and also shape economic arrangements**.
    
- Even ways of living—housing, diet, clothing—**reinforce who is entitled to control energy and who must surrender it**.

From the High Middle Ages to the late Renaissance, new social tools developed that ensured the protection of the worker’s self image and dignity, although he was now sometimes dwarfed by the size of machines. The guild system did indeed give the worker a new claim to the monopoly over tools specific to his trade. 

## Work is miserable?

Tripaliare meant to torture on the trepalium, which was first mentioned in the sixth century as an instrument of impalement made out of three wooden sticks. By the twelfth century the word in both French and Spanish expressed a painful experience to which man is subjected; only in the sixteenth century did it become possible to use the verb trabajar interchangeably with laborar and sudar on the job. 

The alchemist’s dream of making a homunculus in the test tube slowly took the shape of creating robots to work for man, and to educate men to work alongside them. 

## Time is money

New power meant a new relation to time. The lending of money against interest was considered “against nature” by the Church: money naturally was a means of exchange to buy necessities, not a capital that could work or bear fruits. During the seventeenth century even the Church abandoned this view - though reluctantly - to accept the fact that Christians had become capitalist merchants. Time became like money: I now can have a few hours before lunch; how shall I spend time? ... I am short of time so I can’t afford to spend that much time on a committee; it’s not worth the time ... It world be a waste of time; I’d rather save an hour.

Man was reinvented as a source of mechanical power.

## Industrial ways

Immense new sources of power were tapped during the twentieth century, and much of this power became self-governing. Man has now been almost replaced by machines and reduced to being their operator.

Illich echoes **Lewis Mumford’s** concept of the **“mega-machine”**—a system where humans are treated like interchangeable parts in a vast technological apparatus.

- In pre-modern systems, **domination was explicit**: a master commands a slave.
    
- In modern systems, **domination is systemic**:  
    People are trained, conditioned, and shaped to fit the needs of the machine—**not by a person**, but by the **system itself**.
    

Illich is emphasizing **a shift from personal to impersonal control**:

- No one person is directly oppressing another.
    
- Yet people are still deeply **conditioned, disciplined, and controlled**—by **design**, by **infrastructure**, by **habits of technological life**.

Illich contrasts three forms of agricultural labor:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Slave**|Worked under coercion—no control, but not comparison with machines|
|**Peasant**|Worked for himself, in sync with **natural rhythms** (seasons, animals, weather)|
|**Modern farmhand**|Works under pressure to **compete with machines**, even when lacking them|

The **modern farmhand** is in a **worse psychological position** than the slave or the peasant:

- He is forced to **keep up with mechanized laborers**, despite lacking access to the same tools.
    
- He is **aware of his own dispossession** and exploitation.
    
- He feels **inferior**, like a **component** in a larger system, but with **none of the power** that machinery implies.
    

This is **dehumanization by comparison**—not by whip, but by metrics.

## typology of tools and institutions

Illich is distinguishing **three modes of engagement** with tools—each associated with **a particular kind of human activity**:

| Category                | Description                                                                                                                           | Market Treatment                                                                | Examples                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tools for Work**      | Simple, flexible tools used creatively (e.g., hand tools) for individual goals                                                        | Only _results_ can be marketed                                                  | Crafted items, home-cooked meal                                     |
| **Tools for Labor**     | Tools embedded in repetitive, survival-oriented tasks (e.g., machines in factories) that shapes behavior within routine               | Activity itself can be **bought and sold** (waged labor)                        | Warehouse picking, assembly line work                               |
| **Machines to Operate** | Complex systems that require adherence to external procedures. It dictates action, no real control(e.g., cars, digital bureaucracies) | Access is **earned** through prior consumption (e.g., schooling, credentials)\| | Airline pilot, truck driver, hospital technician, certified teacher |



This reflects Illich’s broader concern: tools are not neutral—they **structure human agency**, depending on how and where they are used.
Not all tools are flexible:

- Some tools **enable independent, meaningful work** (e.g., hand tools like hammers, spades, paintbrushes).
    
- Some tools are best suited to **labor**, repetitive or routinized (e.g., factory conveyor belts).
    
- Others are **machines that can only be operated** in specific, tightly controlled contexts (e.g., aircraft, MRI scanners, computers in certain industrial uses).
    

In short: the **design and institutional context of a tool shapes how free or constrained the user is**.


## A convivial future

Illich pushes back on the idea that **technological progress necessitates industrial alienation**.

- Today’s science and technology **could** be used to build **convivial, liberating tools**.
    
- In fact, we are **more capable than ever** of designing **efficient tools that don’t enslave**.
    

But we don’t—**because of systemic bias**.
Illich identifies a **systemic distortion**:

- Science has **specialized and fragmented** away from philosophy and ethics.
    
- Research is now organized to **feed industrial growth**, not public autonomy.
    
- We’ve inherited a **prejudice**: that progress = **more production**, **more complexity**, **more centralization**.
This prejudice distorts:

- How tools are developed (always toward **scale and efficiency**)
    
- How research is funded (serving **industrial pipelines**)
    
- What counts as a breakthrough (often **planned fixes** for industrial bottlenecks)

In summary,

| **Dimension**         | **Work**                                              | **Labor**                                        | **Operation**                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human Experience**  | Creative, autonomous, embedded in life                | Repetitive, survival-based, externally directed  | System-bound, procedural, institutionalized                   |
| **Market Logic**      | Only _results_ (e.g. goods, crafts) are sold          | Activity itself can be bought/sold (waged labor) | Access requires prior _certified consumption_ (school, jobs)  |
| **Tools Used**        | 🛠️ Convivial tools—simple, flexible, user-controlled | 🏭 Industrial tools—shape routine labor          | 🏢 Machines to operate—complex, systemic, require credentials |
| **Access Mechanism**  | Open, relational, skill-based                         | Employment contracts                             | Licenses, degrees, HR filters                                 |
| **Science/Tech Bias** | Could support autonomy and community                  | Drives efficiency within labor markets           | Now mostly oriented to **industrial expansion and control**   |
| **Risk**              | Marginalized by mass production                       | Treated as expendable                            | Becomes gatekeeper of privilege                               |

The division of labor has finally led to the labor-saving division of tools. New technology is now used to amplify supply funnels for commodities. Public utilities are turned from facilities for persons into arenas for the owners of expensive tools.
The use of science and technology constantly supports the industrial mode of production, and thereby crowds off the scene all tool shops for independent enterprise. But this is not the necessary result of new scientific discoveries or of their useful application. It is rather the result of a total prejudice in favor of the future expansion of an industrial mode of production.

Research is now mostly oriented toward industrial development.

Natural and social science can be used for the creation of tools, utilities, and rules available to everyone, permitting individuals and transient associations to constantly recreate their mutual relationships and their environment with unenvisaged freedom and self-expression.

Natural and social science can be used for the creation of tools, utilities, and rules available to everyone, permitting individuals and transient associations to constantly recreate their mutual relationships and their environment with unenvisaged freedom and self-expression.

Limited resources can be used to provide millions of viewers with the color image of one performer or to provide many people with free access to the records of their choice.

In the first case, technology will be used for the further promotion of the specialized worker, be lie a plumber, surgeon, or TV performer. More and more bureaucrats will study the market, consult their balance sheets, and decide for more people on more occasions about the range of products among which they may choose. There will be a further increase of useful things for useless people.

## deprofessionalization

time has come to take the syringe out of the hand of the doctor, as the pen was taken out of the band of the scribe during the Reformation in Europe.

Most curable sickness can now be diagnosed and treated by laymen. People find it so difficult to accept this statement because the complexity of medical ritual has hidden from them the simplicity of its basic procedures. 

Medicine ceases to be a legitimate profession when it cannot provide each man or his next of kin with the tool to make this one crucial differential diagnosis for himself.

Just as with proper social arrangements most people would grow up as readers without having to be schooled and without having to recreate the pre-Gutenberg profession of the scribe, so a sufficient number would grow up competent with medical tools. This would make healing so plentiful that it would be difficult to turn this competence into a monopoly or to sell it as a commodity. 


In capitalist countries how often you can cover great distances is determined by what your can pay.
the particular speed at which you travel puts you into your class and company. Speed is one of the means by which an efficiency-oriented society is stratified.

As a first step, new standards were set for the construction of dwelling units. These standards were intended to protect the little man who purchases a house from exploitation by the industry producing it. Paradoxically, these same standards deprived many more people of the traditional opportunity to house themselves. The code specifies minimum requirements that a man who builds his own house in his spare time cannot meet. Besides that, the real rent for industrially built quarters is more than the total income of 80 percent of the people. “Better housing,” then, can be occupied only by those who are well-off or by those on whom the law bestows direct rent subsidies.

Once dwellings that fall below industrial standards are defined as improper, public funds are denied to the overwhelming majority of people who cannot buy housing but could “house” themselves. The tax funds meant to improve the living quarters of the poor are monopolized for the building of new towns next to the provincial and regional capitals where government employees, unionized workers, and people with good connections can live. These are all people who are employed in the modern sector of the economy, that is, people who hold jobs. They can be easily distinguished from other Mexicans because they have learned to speak about their trabajo as a noun, while the unemployed or the occasionally employed or those who live near the subsistence level do not use the noun form when they go to work.

The pretense of a society to provide ever better housing is the same kind of abberation we have met in the pretense of doctors to provide better health and of engineers to provide higher speeds. The setting of abstract impossible goals turns the means by which these are to be achieved into ends.

In 1945, 32 percent of all one-family housing units in Massachusetts were still self-built: either built by their owners from foundation to roof or constructed under the full responsibility of the owner. By 1970 the proportion had gone down to 11 percent. Meanwhile, housing had been discovered as a major problem. The technological capability to produce tools and materials that favor self-building had increased in the intervening decades, but social arrangements—like unions, codes, mortgage rules, and markets-had turned against this choice.

Most people do not feel at home unless a significant proportion of the value of their houses is the result of the input of their own labor. 

Less than four years of schooling is worse than none. It only defines the former pupil as a dropout. This is equally true in medicine, transportation, and housing, as in agriculture and in the administration of justice. Mechanical transportation is worthwhile only at certain speeds. Conflict resolution is effective only when the issue is of sufficient weight to justify the costs of court action. The planting of new grains is productive only if the acreage and capital of the farmer are beyond a certain size. Powerful tools created to achieve abstractly conceived social goals inevitably deliver their output in quanta that are beyond the reach of a majority. 

Access to key positions in government or industry is reserved to those who are certified consumers of high quanta of schooling. They are the individuals chosen to run the plantation of mutant rubber trees, and they need a car to rush from meeting to meeting. Productivity demands the output of packaged quanta of institutionally defined values, and productive management demands the access of an individual to all these packages at once.

In a convivial society compulsory and open-ended schooling would have to be excluded for the sake of justice. Age-specific, compulsory competition on an unending ladder for lifelong privileges cannot increase equality but must favor those who start earlier, or who are healthier, or who are better equipped outside the classroom. Inevitably, it organizes society into many layers of failure, with each layer inhabited by dropouts schooled to believe that those who have consumed more education deserve more privilege because they are more valuable assets to society as a whole. 

The monopoly of industrial production deprives even privileged clients of control over what they may get. Few people get the cars that most people want, and GM designers can only build vehicles to fit the existing roads.

Every country tends to select those productive processes which are more capital-intensive and promise greater cost-benefit ratios, so that the same kind of technological unemployment is produced everywhere.

The principal source of injustice in our epoch is political approval for the existence of tools that by their very nature restrict to a very few the liberty to use them in an autonomous way. The pompous rituals by which each man is given a vote to choose between factions only cover up the fact that the imperialism of industrial tools is both arbitrary and growing.

People get better education, better health, better transportation, better entertainment, and often even better nourishment only if the experts’ goals are taken as the measurement of what ’better’ means.

**The public owner-ship of resources and of the means of production, arid public control over the market and over net transfers of power, must be complemented by a public determination of the tolerable basic structure of modern tools. This means that politics in a postindustrial society must be mainly concerned with the development of design criteria for tools rather than as now with the choice of production goals. These politics would mean a structural inversion of the institutions now providing and defining new manmade essentials.**

## How to do?

To invert politics, it will not be enough to show that a convivial life style is possible, or even to demonstrate that it is more attractive than life in a society ruled by industrial productivity

We need a way to recognize that the inversion of present political purpose is necessary for the survival of all people.

They long for and expect increased satisfaction, with less input of human energy and with more division of competence. They value handicraft and personal care as luxuries, but the ideal of a more labor-intensive, yet modern, production process seems to them quixotic and anachronistic.

It seems absurd to prepare politicians who have pledged themselves to increased outputs and better distribution of goods and services among their constituents for the day when a majority of voters will choose limits for all rather than promises of equal consumption. It appears equally hopeless to expect inverse insight from humanitarian liberals who have come to feel that feeding the starving millions is their vocation. They forget that people eat, and that people die when they are fed. These self-appointed keepers of their brothers make other people’s survival depend on their own growing efficiency. 
Their hubris distracts them from understanding that only the renunciation of industrial expansion can bring food and population into a balance in the so-called backward countries.


## 

The human equilibrium is open. It is capable of shifting within flexible but finite parameters. People can change, but only within bounds. In contrast, the present industrial system is dynamically unstable. It is organized for indefinite expansion and the concurrent unlimited creation of new needs, which in an industrial environment soon become basic necessities.

The demands made by tools on people become increasingly costly. This rising cost of fitting man to the service of his tools is reflected in the ongoing shift from goods to services in over-all production. Increasing manipulation of man becomes necessary to overcome the resistance of his vital equilibrium to the dynamic of growing industries; it takes the form of educational, medical, and administrative therapies. Education turns out competitive consumers; medicine keeps them alive in the engineered environment they have come to require; bureaucracy reflects the necessity of exercising social control over people to do meaningless work.

The environmental crisis, for example, is rendered superficial if it is not pointed out that antipollution devices can only be effective if the total output of production decreases. Otherwise they tend to shift garbage out of sight, push it into the future, or dump it onto the poor.

Making antipollution devices compulsory only increases the unit cost of the product. This may conserve some fresh air for all, because fewer people can afford to drive cars or sleep in air-conditioned homes or fly to a fishing ground on the weekend, but it replaces damage to the physical environment with further social disintegration.

I will identify six ways in which all people of the world are threatened by industrial development after passage through the second watershed: (1) Overgrowth threatens the right to the fundamental physical structure of the environment with which man has evolved. (2) Industrialization threatens the right to convivial work. (3) The overprogramming of man for the new environment deadens his creative imagination. (4) New levels of productivity threaten the right to participatory politics. (5) Enforced obsolescence threatens the right to tradition: the recourse to precedent in language, myth, morals, and judgment. I will describe these five threats as distinct though interrelated categories all having in common a destructive inversion of means into ends. (6) Pervasive frustration by means of compulsory though engineered satisfaction constitutes a sixth and more subtle threat.

 These six categories can serve in the recovery of procedural principles by which people can expose and redress the present imbalance in the functioning of tools. These underlying principles of moral, political, and juridical procedure I assume to be three: recognition of the legitimacy of personal conflict, the dialectic authority of history over present procedures, and the recourse to laymen or peers for binding policy decisions. The radical functional inversion of our major institutions constitutes a revolution much more profound than the shifts in ownership or power usually proposed. It can be neither envisaged nor enacted unless a basic structure of procedure is recovered and clearly agreed upon.

Three trends have indeed been identified, each of them tending to upset the balance between man and the physical environment. Overpopulation makes more people dependent on limited resources. Affluence compels each person to use more energy. Faulty technology degrades energy in an inefficient way.

Honesty requires that we each recognize the need to limit procreation, consumption, and waste, but equally we must radically reduce our expectations that machines will do our work for us or that therapists can make us learned or healthy. The only solution to the environmental crisis is the shared insight of people that they would be happier if they could work together and care for each other. 

The re-establishment of an ecological balance depends on the ability of society to counteract the progressive materialization of values. Otherwise man will find himself totally enclosed within his artificial creation, with no exit. Enveloped in a physical, social, and psychological milieu of his own making, he will be a prisoner in the shell of technology, unable to find again the ancient milieu to which he was adapted for hundreds of thousands of years. The ecological balance cannot be re-established unless we recognize again that only persons have ends and that only persons can work toward them. Machines only operate ruthlessly to reduce people to the role of impotent allies in their destructive progress.

I speak about radical monopoly when one industrial production process exercises an exclusive control over the satisfaction of a pressing need, and excludes nonindustrial activities from competition.
Cars can thus monopolize traffic. They can shape a city into their image - practically ruling out locomotion on foot or by bicycle in Los Angeles. They can eliminate river traffic in Thailand. That motor traffic curtails the right to walk, not that more people drive Chevies than Fords, constitutes radical monopoly. 
It destroys the environment for feet and bicycles. Even if planes and buses could run as nonpolluting, nondepleting public services, their inhuman velocities would degrade man’s innate mobility and force him to spend more time for the sake of travel.
Schools tried to extend a radical monopoly on learning by redefining it as education. As long as people accepted the teacher’s definition of reality, those who learned outside school were officially stamped “uneducated”. Modern medicine deprives the ailing of care not prescribed by doctors. Radical monopoly exists where a major tool rules out natural competence. Radical monopoly imposes compulsory consumption and thereby restricts personal autonomy. It constitutes a special kind of social control because it is enforced by means of the imposed consumption of a standard product that only large institutions can provide.
Each party promises more funds to doctors, hospitals, and drugstores. Such promises are not in the interest of the majority. They only serve to increase the power of a minority of professionals to prescribe the tools men are to use in maintaining health, healing sickness, and repressing death. More funds will strengthen the hold of the health industry over public resources and heighten its prestige and arbitrary power. Such power in the hands of a minority will produce only an increase in suffering and a decrease in personal self-reliance. More money will be invested in tools that only postpone unavoidable death and in services that abridge even further the civil rights of those who want to heal each other. More money spent under the control of the health profession means that more people are operationally conditioned into playing the role of the sick, a role they are not allowed to interpret for themselves. Once they accept this role, their most trivial needs can be satisfied only through commodities that are scarce by professional definition.
People have a native capacity for healing, consoling, moving, learning, building their houses, and burying their dead. Each of these capacities meets a need. The means for the satisfaction of these needs are abundant so long as they depend primarily on what people can do for themselves, with only marginal dependence on commodities. These activities have use-value without having been given exchange-value. Their exercise at the service of man is not considered labor.

These basic satisfactions become scarce when the social environment is transformed in such a manner that basic needs can no longer be met by abundant competence. The establishment of radical monopoly happens when people give up their native ability to do what they can do for themselves and for each other, in exchange for something “better” that can be done for them only by a major tool. 

They need this protection even if the majority is now sold on the professional’s services. Unless the need for protection from radical monopoly is recognized, its multiple implementation can break the tolerance of man for enforced inactivity and passivity.

Procedures must be used that permit any party who feels threatened by compulsory consumption to claim protection, whatever form the imposition takes. Like intolerable pollution, intolerable monopoly cannot be defined in advance. The threat can be anticipated, but the definition of its precise nature can result only from people’s participation in deciding what may not be produced.

They drive cars because they consider the pollution created by one car insignificant, and because they do not feel personally deprived of freedom when they drive. It is also difficult to be protected against monopoly when a society is already littered with roads, schools, or hospitals, when independent action has been paralyzed for so long that the ability for it seems to have atrophied, and when simple alternatives seem beyond the reach of the imagination.

The cost of radical monopoly is already borne by the public and will be broken only if the public realizes that it would be better off paying the costs of ending the monopoly than by continuing to pay for its maintenance. But the price will not be paid unless the public learns to value the potential of a convivial society over the illusion of progress. It will not be paid voluntarily by those who confuse conviviality with intolerable poverty.

Consumers cannot do without cars. They buy different makes. They discover that most cars are unsafe at any speed. So they organize to get safer, better, and more durable cars and to get more as well as wider and safer roads. Yet when consumers gain more confidence in cars, the victory only increases society’s dependence on high-powered vehicles - public or private - and frustrates even more those who have to, or would prefer to, walk.


%% So here, answering consumer needs word for word is not a desirable action on the part of a designer %%

Discerning consumers who are discriminatory in their purchasing habits may finally discover that they can do better by doing things for themselves.

%% So the extreme case in itself, includes the potential to solve that extremity %%

Protection against radical monopoly depends on a political consensus opposed to growth. 


## Overprogramming

The balance of learning is determined by the ratio of two kinds of knowledge in a society. The first is a result of the creative action of people on their environment, and the second accrues to them as a result of purposeful and programmed training to which they are subjected. 
No sane person would say that speaking or walking or nursing a child is primarily the result of education, while competence in mathematics, ballet dancing, or painting usually is.
The relation between what can be learned from ordinary living and what must be learned as a result of intentional teaching differs widely with place and time. It depends very much on rituals. All Muslims learn some Arabic as the result of prayer. This learning evolves from interaction in a context bounded by tradition. In much the same manner, peasants pick up the folklore of their region. Class and caste also generate opportunities to learn. The rich acquire “proper” table manners or accents and insist that these cannot be taught. The poor learn to fend in dignity where no education could teach the rich to survive.

Crucial to how much anyone can learn on his own is the structure of his tools: the less they are convivial, the more they foster teaching.

%% AI can be a high-level of convivial tools that allow high-level of self-learning complex knowledge %%

Mastery of skill does not yet imply a monopoly of understanding. One can understand fully what a goldsmith does without being one oneself Men do not have to be cooks to know how to prepare food. This combination of widely shared information and competence for using it is characteristic of a society in which convivial tools prevail. 

Total learning expands when the range of spontaneous learning widens along with access to an increasing number of taught skills and both liberty and discipline flower. This expansion of the balance of learning cannot go on forever; it is self-limiting. It can be optimized, but it cannot be forcibly extended.
When centralization and specialization grow beyond a certain point, they require highly programmed operators and clients. More of what each man must know is due to what another man has designed and has the power to force on him.

The inhabitant of the city is in touch with thousands of systems, but only peripherally with each. He knows how to operate the TV or the telephone, but their workings are hidden from him. Learning by primary experience is restricted to self¬ adjustment in the midst of packaged commodities. He feels less and less secure in doing his own thing. 
The balance of learning deteriorates: it is skewed in favor of “education”. People know what they have been taught, but learn little from their own doing. People come to feel that they need “education”.

Learning thus becomes a commodity, and, like any commodity that is marketed, it becomes scarce. 

When people become obsolete and need constantly to renew their educational security, when the accountant must be reprogrammed for each new generation of computers, then learning has indeed become scarce.

- **Education is getting more expensive**: The money it takes to train or educate people is going up faster than the amount of useful output (like goods, services, or productivity) that society gets from it.
    
- **Two ways to look at this**:
    
    - One view sees education as a tool to make society more productive by investing in people’s knowledge and skills.
        
    - But if education keeps getting more expensive without increasing productivity fast enough, society may reach a point where more education doesn’t help much ("an asymptote" = a limit or ceiling).
        
- **What some people propose**: To fix this, people might try to make education more efficient—get more results for less cost. This means changing or cutting back traditional schooling. Problematic proposal from Hashizume [[Critique of a book]]
    
- **Author’s concern**: The writer thinks this push to make education more "rational" (efficient) could hurt students. Traditional schools, even if flawed and inefficient, at least offer some protections or rights to students.
    
- **Warning**: If education is taken out of traditional schools and given to other educators or systems without those restraints, it might become more powerful—but also more dangerous, because it could be used to control or manipulate people more effectively.

- **Big issue**: Both the “education as productivity” view _and_ the “education as a luxury good” view make the same mistake: they don’t see the difference between learning that’s free, voluntary, and creative (what the author calls “convivial tools”) and learning that’s forced or manipulative (controlled by others).

Man will wither away just as much if he is deprived of nature, of his own work, or of his deep need to learn what he wants and not what others have planned that he should learn.

%% In a tech-driven world, people are inevitably forced to learn what is scarce, what is not naturally endowed, and what can provide them the "leverage". However, this line of reasoning finally goes back to what we innately had when we embarked on the journey to encounter the technology: the curiosity and drive, the very qualities we are endangering through the context in which we approach the technology, that of seeking scarcity and leverage. And so we landed on a catch 22: : can't escape because of the logic of the escape condition itself %%

Poetry, intuition, and theory can offer intimations of the advance of dogma against wit that may lead to a revolution in awareness. 

Only the separation of Church and State, of compulsory knowledge from political action, can redress the balance of learning. The law has been used, and can be used again, to this purpose. The law has protected societies against the exaggerated claims of its priests, and can protect it against the claims of educators. Compulsory school attendance or other compulsory treatment is analogous to compulsory attendance at a religious ritual. The law can disestablish it. The law can be used against the rising cost of education, and against the use of education in the reproduction of a class society.

the possibility of a society where work and leisure and politics would favor learning and that could function with less formal education;
permits us to set up educational arrangements that favor self-initiated, self-chosen learning, and that relegate programmed teaching to limited, clearly specified occasions.

Industrial jobs are arranged so that the better-schooled fit into the scarcer slots. Scarce jobs are defined as more productive, so people with less schooling are barred from access to the more desirable goods produced in the new industries.

People are deprived of their ability to invest their own time with the power to produce use-value, and are compelled to work for wages and to exchange their earnings for industrially defined rented space. They are deprived also of the opportunity to learn while building.


%% I do this for my own existence, that initially does not have a market price and wage, since that's what I do for myself, and its invaluable %%


In New York people with less than twelve years of schooling are treated like cripples: they tend to be unemployable, and are controlled by social workers who decide for them how to live. The radical monopoly of overefficient tools exacts from society the increasing and costly conditioning of clients. Ford produces cars that can be repaired only by trained mechanics. Agriculture departments turn out high-yield crops that can be used only with the assistance of farm managers who have survived an expensive school race. The production of better health, higher speeds, or greater yields depends on more disciplined recipients. The real cost of these doubtful benefits is hidden by unloading much of them on the schools that produce social control.


## Zines and Riso

The book is the result of two major inventions that enormously extended the balance of learning: the alphabet and the printing press. Both techniques are almost ideally convivial. Almost anybody can learn to use them, and for his own purpose. They use cheap materials. People can take them or leave them as they wish. They are not easily controlled by third parties. Even the Soviet government cannot stop the samizdat circulation of subversive typescripts.

The alphabet and the printing press have in principle deprofessionalized the recorded word. With the alphabet the merchant broke the monopoly of the priest over hieroglyphs. With cheap paper and pencil, and later with the typewriter and modern copying devices, a set of new techniques had in principle opened the era of nonprofessional, truly convivial, communication by record. The tape recorder and camera added new media to fully interactive communication.

The per capita purchase of nontechnical books by high-school graduates declines with the increased percentage of people who finish high school. More books are written for the school-trained specialist, and the self-initiated reading of books declines. 

At its best the library is the prototype of a convivial tool. Repositories for other learning tools can be organized on its model, expanding access to tapes, pictures, records, and very simple labs filled with the same scientific instruments with which most of the major breakthroughs of the last century were made.

We should learn to ask first what people need if they want to learn and provide these tools for them. 

People must learn to live within bounds. This cannot be taught. Survival depends on people learning fast what they cannot do. They must learn to abstain from unlimited progeny, consumption, and use. It is impossible to educate people for voluntary poverty or to manipulate them into self-control. It is impossible to teach joyful renunciation in a world totally structured for higher output and the illusion of declining costs.

%% It is impossible to demand others to renunciate high-paying jobs and contribute as much as possible to open- and free- tools %%

## A Case of Birth Control

Man has evolved in a small corner of the universe. His world is bounded by the resources of the ecosphere, and can accommodate only a limited number of people. Technology has transformed the characteristics of this niche. The ecosphere now accommodates a larger number of people, each less vitally adapted to the environment - each on the average having less space, less freedom to survive with simple means, fewer roots in tradition. The attempt to make a better environment has turned out to be as presumptuous as the attempt to create better health, education, or communication. As a result there are now more people, most of them less at home in the world. This large population can survive because of new tools. In turn, it spurs the search for even more powerful tools, and thereby demands more radical monopoly; this monopoly, in its turn, calls for more and more education. But, paradoxically, what people most need to learn, they cannot be taught or educated to do. If they are voluntarily to keep their numbers and consumption within bounds, they must learn to do so by living active and responsible lives, or they will perish passive though well informed, frustrated yet resigned. 


- **Voluntary self-restraint is essential**:  
    People must choose to limit their population growth and consumption _on their own_, by living active, responsible lives. If they don’t, they risk suffering and collapse—even if they are educated or well-informed.
    
- **Living under too much control makes true choices impossible**:  
    Real, voluntary control is _not possible_ in a society where powerful systems (like mass media, corporations, or governments) dominate all aspects of life—what the author calls "radical monopoly" and "overprogramming." These systems take away people’s ability to think and act for themselves.
    
- **Programs that try to control people for them will fail**:  
    Specialized, top-down population control efforts (like birth control campaigns run by institutions) won’t work. They might start by trying to persuade people ("seduction"), but if that fails, they may move toward _forcing_ people (e.g., with sterilization or abortion).
    
- **Such systems can become dangerous**:  
    In the worst case, these efforts could lead to justifying mass death—treating the elimination of people as necessary for society or the planet.


But this universal practice cannot possibly be the result of some miracle tool. A new practice, inverse to the present, can only be the result of a new relationship between people and their tools. The universal practice of effective contraception is a necessary premise for the limitation of tools which I advocate. But equally, the psychological inversion that will accompany a limitation of tools is a premise for the convivial psychological pressure necessary for effective contraception.

The devices needed for birth control are a paradigm for modern convivial tools. They incorporate science in instruments that can be handled by any reasonably prudent and well-apprenticed person. They provide new ways to engage in the millenary practice of contraception, sterilization, and abortion. They are cheap enough to be made universally available. They are made to fit alternate tasks, beliefs, and situations. They are obviously tools that structure the bodily relationship of each individual to himself and to others. To be effective, some must be used by every adult, and many of them must be used every day. Birth control is an immense task. 

It is ridiculous to try to control populations with tools which by their nature are convivial while conditioning the population by formal education to fit more effectively into an industrial and professional world. It is absurd to expect that Brazilian peasants can be taught to depend on doctors for injections and prescriptions, on lawyers for conflict resolution, and on teachers for learning to read, while asking them to use the condom on their own. 

%% People are well-rounder, every action is interrelated %%

Professional taboos and industrial tools stand and fall together once truly rational, postindustrial tools are available. Only the convergent use of convivial tools in all significant areas of need-satisfaction can render their use in each sector truly effective. Only among convivially structured tools can people learn to use the new levels of power that modern technology can incorporate in them.

## Polarization

The underprivileged grow in number, while the already privileged grow in affluence.

Significant benefits for the poor demand a reduction of the resources used by the rich, while significant benefits for the rich make murderous demands on the resources of the poor. Yet the rich pretend that by exploiting the poor nations they will become rich enough to create a hyperindustrial abundance for all. The elites of poor countries share this fantasy.

Poverty levels rise because industrial staples are turned into basic necessities and have a unit cost beyond what a majority could ever pay. 

The former subsistence farmer is put out of business by the green revolution. He earns more as a laborer, but he cannot give his children their former diet. More importantly, the U.S. citizen with ten times his income is also desperately poor. Both get increasingly less at greater cost.

 1. **Root problem: Unequal inputs, not just outputs**

- Simply trying to fix _income inequality_ or _uneven outcomes_ (outputs) doesn't solve the deeper issue: the unequal **structure of inputs**—that is, who gets access to meaningful tools, opportunities, and roles in society.
    
- If we don’t address these deep input inequalities, short-term fixes will actually make long-term poverty worse. This is what Illich calls the “modernization of poverty.”
    

---

2. **Superficial fixes won’t solve deeper inequality**

- Income equalization (through taxes, welfare, etc.) can help address _visible_ inequality.
    
- But real privilege in modern industrial society isn’t about money alone—it’s about access to **time-saving, empowering tools** like jobs, transportation, and specialized knowledge.
    
- The wealthy or "privileged" aren't just richer—they're certified to access powerful tools and systems.
    
- These privileges are built into the very structure of industrial society, where people are ranked by their “knowledge capital” and usefulness in the workforce—not by their needs or humanity.
    

---

3. **Industrial society centralizes control more than ever**

- In ancient societies (e.g., with agriculture and slavery), control was based on religion, ideology, or force—but the actual amount of power controlled was limited.
    
- In contrast, **modern industrial society controls vastly more power**—mainly through energy and technology (e.g., switches, machines)—with far greater reach and efficiency than old methods like whips or coercion.
    
- The control is now hidden, automatic, and much more centralized, "If capital means the power to make effective change, power inflation has reduced most people to paupers."

As tools get bigger, the number of potential operators declines. There are always fewer operators of cranes than of wheelbarrows. As tools become more efficient, more scarce resources are put at the service of the operator.
On a Guatemalan construction site, only the engineer gets air conditioning in his trailer. He is also the only one whose time is deemed so precious that he must be flown to the capital, and whose decisions seem so important that they are transmitted by shortwave radio. He has of course earned his privileges by cornering the largest amount of tax money and using it to acquire a university degree. The Indio who works on the gang does not notice the relative increase in privilege between him and his Ladino gang boss, but the geometricians and draftsmen who also went to school, but did not graduate, feel the heat and the distance from their families in a new and acute way. Their relative poverty has been aggravated by their bosses’ claim to greater efficiency.

Never before have tools approached present power. Never before have they been so integrated at the service of a small Hite. 
High-speed transportation, broad band-width communication, special health maintenance, and unlimited bureaucratic assistance are all explained as requirements to get the most out of the most highly capitalized people.

As long as a minority acts to increase its share within a growth-oriented society, the final result will be a keener sense of inferiority for most of its members.

## Power of women

- **Industrial progress creates losers:**  
    As industries grow, they always produce groups of people who don’t get enough work or can't afford to consume like others. These people are a _by-product_ of industrial growth—not just temporary problems.
    
- **Awareness through organization:**  
    When people in these disadvantaged groups connect and organize, they start to see their situation as something shared, not individual failure.
    
- **Current activism is limited:**  
    Right now, most social movements focus on getting _equal treatment_—for example, demanding equal pay or access to resources. These are _output-focused_ goals.
    
- **A deeper change is possible:**  
    Real transformation could happen if people instead demanded _equal work_—not just to get paid the same, but to participate equally in meaningful, productive activity. This means focusing on _inputs_ (what kind of work people do), not just outcomes.
    
- **Why women are central to this:**
    
    - Women are present in every race and class.
        
    - Much of their work (e.g., childrearing, caregiving, housework) is done outside of the industrial system.
        
    - Industrial society _depends_ on women doing this non-industrial work because it can't be easily automated or scaled.
        
- **This work is devalued:**  
    In a society obsessed with industrial efficiency, domestic and caregiving tasks are seen as unimportant or "less than." If you try to industrialize them (by assigning wages or treating them like factory jobs), they become even more dehumanizing.
    
- **Radical potential of a women-led movement:**  
    If women demanded recognition for the value of _non-industrial_ work and insisted that no single type of production (like industrial work) should dominate, it could challenge the entire system. It would force society to accept that multiple forms of work are equally valid and necessary.


##

It does imply the adoption of labor-intensive tools, but not the regression to inefficient tools.

 In the present scheme of large-scale obsolescence a few corporate centers of decision¬ making impose compulsory innovation on the entire society. Continued convivial reconstruction depends on the degree to which society protects the power of individuals and of communities to choose their own styles of life through effective, small-scale renewal

Product elaboration and obsolescence are two distinct dimensions of overefficiency, both of which underpin a society of hierarchically layered privilege.
The most effective way to open a market is to identify the use of what is new as an important privilege. If this identification succeeds, the old model is devalued and the self-interest of the consumer is wedded to the ideology of never-ending and progressive consumption. 
If new things are made because they are better, then the things most people use are not quite good. New models constantly renovate poverty. The consumer feels the lag between what he has and what he ought to get. He believes that products can be made measurably more valuable and allows himself to be constantly re¬ educated for their consumption. The “better” replaces the “good” as the fundamental normative concept.

What people have and what they are about to get are equally exasperating to them. Accelerating change has become both addictive and intolerable. 


## Design the speed

**Human Needs Set Limits on Technological Change**

- If the environment (tools, systems, norms) changes too quickly, people can’t adapt.
    
- Humans need _language, law, memory, and myth_ to live well. These depend on some level of _stability_.
    
- Therefore, there must be **limits on how fast society and technology change**, so that people can still make sense of the world and participate in it.

Commuter transportation leads to negative returns when it admits, anywhere in the system, speeds much above those reached on a bicycle. Once the barrier of bicycle velocity is broken at any point in the system, the total per capita monthly time spent at the service of the travel industry increases.

### **Humans Have Limits**

- People can only tolerate **so much control and routine**.
    
- As systems (like fast transportation) **speed up**, they require **stricter social controls** (rules, surveillance, discipline), which push people **beyond their capacity** to cope.
## Counterfoil research


Even clean and equally distributed electricity could lead to intolerable radical monopoly of power tools over man’s personal energy. Not only compulsory schools but pervasive teaching media can be used to upset the balance of learning or to polarize society into an oppressive meritocracy. Any form of engineering can lead to unendurable obsolescence. It is true that man’s physical niche is threatened; but just as he evolved within one particular physiological environment, so he also evolved within a social, political and psychological environment which can also be irreversibly destroyed.

I have argued that in each of five realms conceptual criteria can be used to recognize escalating imbalance. These criteria serve as guidelines for political processes by which the members of a technological society can develop constitutive boundaries within which tools must be kept. Such boundaries circumscribe the kind of power structures that can be kept under the control of people. By growing beyond this range, tools escape political control. Man’s ability to claim his rights is extinguished by his bondage to processes over which he has no say. Biological functions, work, meaning, freedom, and roots - insofar as he can still enjoy them are reduced to concessions, which optimize the logic of tools. Man is reduced to an indefinitely malleable resource of a corporate state. Without constitutive limits translated into constitutional provisions survival in dignity and freedom is squelched.

Counterfoil research also has two major tasks; to provide guidelines for detecting the incipient stages of murderous logic in a tool; and to devise tools and tool systems that optimize the balance of life, thereby maximizing liberty for all.

### **Humans Live in Multiple Layers of Society**

- Each person exists within **concentric circles of social environments**:
    
    - Small groups (family/friends)
        
    - Workplaces
        
    - Cities
        
    - Nations
        
    - The global community
        
- Each of these environments has **natural scales or limits**—like:
    
    - How much distance can be covered
        
    - How much time makes sense for activities
        
    - How many people can interact meaningfully
        
    - How much energy can be used or absorbed
        

---

### **When Tools Exceed Natural Scales, They Become Harmful**

- Tools (or technologies) that **require too much time, space, energy, or scale** _disrupt_ the balance (homeostasis) of these environments.
    
- For example:
    
    - A transportation system that requires long commutes may damage community life.
        
    - A school system scaled to national testing may neglect real learning in classrooms.
        

---

### **Current Problem: Abstract Goals Replace Human-Scale Needs**

- Today’s society defines needs in terms of **abstract targets** (like productivity, efficiency, profit).
    
- But this ignores whether the **tools and systems actually match human dimensions**.


- In ancient mythology (likely Greek), **Hades** is the underworld—the realm of the dead.
    
- The worst punishment in Hades was to be **forced to act in a maddening, irrational way** over and over again.
    
- This punishment was especially reserved for people who **blasphemed**—i.e., disrespected or defied the gods or sacred order.
    

### **Limits Must Be Political, Not Just Technical**

- Some safety limits (like preventing pollution or accidents) are clear and **empirical**.
    
- But **more fundamental questions**—like _how much speed is worth how much stress or loss of freedom_—are **conceptual and political**.
    
- These require **public decision-making**, not just technical fixes.

The energy used up in the United States for the sole purpose of driving vehicles built to accelerate beyond bicycle speed would suffice to add auxiliary motors to about twenty times that many vehicles for people all over the world who want to move at bicycle speeds and do not or cannot push the pedals because they are sick or old, or because they want to transport a heavy load or move over a great distance, or because they just want to relax. Simply on the basis of equal distribution on a world-wide scale, speeds above those attained by bicycles could be ruled out. It is of course mere fantasy to assume an egalitarian consensus sufficiently strong to accept such a proposal. At closer inspection though, many communities will find that the very same speed limit necessary for equal distribution of mobility is also very close to the optimum velocity giving maximum value to community life. At 20 mph constant speed Phileas Fogg could have made his trip around the world in half of eighty days. Simulation studies would be useful for exploring imaginative policies that seek optimal liberty with convivial power tools. 

Counterfoil research leads to the identification of those classes of people most immediately hurt by such trends and helps people to identify themselves as members of such classes. It points out how a particular freedom can be jeopardized for the members of various groups which have otherwise conflicting interests. Counterfoil research involves the public by showing that the demands for freedom of any group or alliance can be identified with the implicit interest of all.


### **1. Nature and Technology**

- **Using nature** is good—**only if it doesn’t destroy nature’s usefulness** for people.
    
- Example: Energy and farming must be sustainable, not destructive.
    

> 🌿 _Don’t use nature in a way that makes it unusable for future generations._

---

### **2. Institutions and Personal Autonomy**

- Institutions (like hospitals, governments, schools) are helpful **only if they don’t take over what people can do for themselves.**
    
- There must be a **balance between personal action and institutional service**.
    

> 🛠 _Tools and systems should empower people, not replace their initiative._

---

### **3. Learning and Schooling**

- Formal education must not **suppress self-directed learning**.
    
- Schools should **support curiosity and independence**, not control learning entirely.
    

> 📚 _Learning arrangements should leave room for freedom and discovery._

---

### **4. Social Mobility and Power**

- Giving people the chance to **move upward socially** is good.
    
- But it only truly humanizes society if it also **reduces the gap in power** between the elite and the rest.
    

> ⚖️ _Fair opportunity must go hand-in-hand with greater equality._

---

### **5. Innovation and Meaning**

- Technological or cultural innovation is valuable **only if it also deepens tradition, meaning, and security**.
    
- Rapid change must not **uproot people or destroy their sense of belonging**.
    

> 🔄 _Progress should add depth, not erase identity._


There are two ranges in the growth of tools: the range within which machines are used to extend human capability and the range in which they are used to contract, eliminate, or replace human functions. 

## Hade

> When maddening behavior becomes the standard of a society, people learn to compete for the right to engage in it. Envy blinds people and makes them compete for addiction.


### **Interpretation:**

> Being **trapped in endless, senseless behavior** was seen as the most severe torment—not pain, but **losing control of one’s mind and actions**.
> 
> This reflects the idea that **madness without choice**, especially when imposed by a higher power or system, is more terrifying than physical suffering.

### **Modern Relevance (Possible Illichian Reading):**

If read through Ivan Illich’s lens, the phrase might metaphorically criticize modern life:

- Today’s industrial systems **impose compulsory, senseless routines** on people (constant retraining, endless consumption, meaningless work).
    
- This is a kind of modern “Hades”—a punishment for defying human-scale, meaningful ways of living.
### Relevance to AI Commons  
- Tools did not **amplify power autonomously**—they **depended on the operator**.
How useful is output created from scratch by AI, that nobody can feel the ownership.

## Science

Above all, political discussion is stunned by a delusion about science. This term has come to mean an institutional enterprise rather than a personal activity, the solving of puzzles rather than the unpredictably creative activity of individual people. 

Books or computers are part of the world. They can yield information when they are looked upon. We move the problem of learning and of cognition nicely into the blind spot of our intellectual vision if we confuse vehicles for potential information with information itself.

### **Loss of Decision-Making Power**

- As people **lose the ability to make real choices** about their lives (due to systems, institutions, or technology making decisions for them),
    
- Their **expectations change**—they no longer act as autonomous individuals but become passive followers of what the system offers.
    

> 🧠 _Instead of thinking: “What do I really need?” people ask: “How do I win what I’m told I should want?”_


### **From Scarcity to Promises**

- In the past, people **fought over real, limited resources**—land, food, jobs.
    
- Now, people **compete for promises**—like success, happiness, progress—which are **abundant in appearance** but often **unreal or unreachable**.

Recourse to better knowledge produced by science not only voids personal decisions of the power to contribute to an ongoing historical and social process, it also destroys the rules of evidence by which experience is traditionally shared. The knowledge-consumer depends on getting packaged programs funneled into him. 

xperts can define standards at levels slightly below those at which people complain with too much force. They can keep the public sullen and forestall mutiny. But closed peer groups cannot be entrusted with self-restraint in furthering their expert knowledge. Nor can we expect them to be representative of the common man. Scientific expertise cannot define what people will tolerate. No person can abdicate the right to decide on this for himself 

Only a political community can dialectically choose the dimensions of the roof under which its members will live.

- **industrial production** started to **dominate other forms of work** (like household labor, farming, and crafts).
    
- Society began to **judge all human activity**—not just factory work—by the **standards of industrial performance**: speed, efficiency, output.
    
- Activities once done for **use or self-sufficiency** (like cooking, sewing, or building your own home) began to be seen as **inefficient or backward**.

### **Conflict Can Expand Freedom**

- When people fight for things like:
    
    - the **right to walk** freely,
        
    - to **shape society**,
        
    - to **speak and be heard**,
        
    - to **live in clean air**,
        
    - or to **use human-centered (convivial) tools**,
        
    
    they aren’t competing for commodities—they’re struggling for **shared, non-scarce rights**.
    
- These gains may reduce material affluence for both sides, but they create something much more valuable: **new liberty**.
### **Language Shapes What We Can Imagine**

- In many societies, **language has become so corrupted** that people can no longer tell the difference between:
    
    - a **claim to a commodity** (e.g., “I want more goods”) and
        
    - a **right to a convivial tool** (e.g., “I want a system that empowers everyone to act”).
        
- As a result, people **can’t even talk about limits on technology**—they assume all tools are good if they increase productivity or wealth.

Limiting tools for the sake of freedom and conviviality is now such an issue that cannot be raised. 

Along with the idolatry of scientific method and the corruption of language, this progressive loss of confidence in political and legal processes is a major obstacle to retooling society.

People come to understand that an alternative society is possible by using clear language. They can bring it about by recovering consciousness of the deep structure by which, in their society, decisions are made. Such a structure exists wherever people form a community.

### **Moral, Political, and Legal Institutions Have Been Co-opted**

- Examples of this misuse:
    
    - **Christian churches** preach values like humility and charity, but **invest in or support industrial expansion**.
        
    - **Socialist regimes**, which claim to serve the people, often end up enforcing **rigid, centralized production systems** (e.g., Stalinist models).
        
    - **Laws** that once protected individuals now increasingly **favor corporations**.
        

> 🛠️ _All types of authority—moral, political, and legal—are now aligned with the growth of tools, not human freedom._

---

### **The Threat of Computerized Decision-Making**

- Soon, even more power will be handed to **computers and algorithms**, which will decide “what should be done” at every turn—not for people, but **for the benefit of tools and systems**.
    
- This could further strip people of their ability to participate in shaping their own lives.


Unless people agree on a process that can be continuously, convivially, and effectively used to control society’s tools, the inversion of the present institutional structure cannot be either enacted or, what is more important, precariously maintained. Managers will always re-emerge to increase institutional productivity and capture public support for the better service they promise.


Much wider scope could be given to alternative mechanisms to allow for greater participation by the nonprofessional, such as mediation, conciliation, and arbitration.

### **Complexity Doesn’t Mean Exclusivity**

- Even if some legal matters stay complex, **the system doesn’t have to be exclusive or mystified**.
    
- We could:
    
    - Create **community-based parajuridical systems** (informal legal structures),
        
    - Expand use of **mediation, conciliation, and arbitration**, which allow **non-lawyers** to resolve conflicts fairly.
        

> 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 _There are many ways to bring justice that don’t require a law degree._

---

### **3. Law Can—and Should—Be More Democratic**

- Legal processes, especially those tied to regulating **large production systems**, should be:
    
    - **Decentralized** (spread out across communities),
        
    - **Demystified** (made easier to understand),
        
    - **Debureaucratized** (stripped of unnecessary red tape).
        

> 🌍 _Even global law can be made more open, fair, and participatory._

---

### **4. Experts May Still Be Needed—But Not Exclusive Elites**

- For complex, cross-cultural or global legal issues, **some expertise is still necessary**.
    
- But that doesn’t mean the experts must be:
    
    - **Law school graduates**, or
        
    - **Members of an elite legal class**.
        
- Instead, **legal skill could come from experience, training, or community leadership**, not just credentials.


### **Common Law as a Tool for Understanding Social Conflict**

- The **adversarial system** (used in common law) is important: it doesn’t decide what is ethically “good” or technically “right.”
    
- Instead, it treats legal cases as **conflicts between parties**, and helps society **understand and manage those mutual tensions**.
    

> 🤝 _Law isn’t about moral truth—it’s about resolving shared conflicts and refining norms through disagreement._



The use of procedure for the purpose of hampering, stopping, and inverting our major institutions will appear to their managers and addicts as a misuse of the law and as subversion of the only order which they recognize. The use of due convivial procedure appears corrupt and criminal to the bureaucrat, even one who calls himself a judge.

### **The Nightmare: A High-Tech Prison**

- If we keep growing for growth’s sake, **humans will be redesigned** to tolerate the unnatural world we’ve created.
    
- This means:
    
    - Living in **artificial environments** (like “plastic bubbles”) just to survive,
        
    - Being **engineered psychologically** to fit into a dehumanized system,
        
    - Spending life in **global institutions**—schools, hospitals, media networks—that feel like **prisons**.
        

> 🧬 _Instead of tools serving people, people would be reshaped to serve tools._

---

### **2. Engineering the Human for Growth**

- In such a world, **man himself becomes the project**—no longer an agent of freedom, but a subject to be adjusted and managed.
    
- Engineering would focus not just on machines, but on **designing people to endure more control** and less meaning.
    

> 🛠️ _The dream of reason would become a nightmare of control._

---

### **3. The Alternative: Political, Frugal, Convivial Society**

- We must instead build a society based on:
    
    - **Shared political decision-making** about fair limits on resources,
        
    - **Stable boundaries** that are _agreed upon_, not imposed,
        
    - **Incentives** to help more people live better with _less_, through creativity and cooperation.
        

> 🌱 _Doing more with less—not by compulsion, but by choice and shared values._

---

### **4. How to Make This Possible (3 Steps)**

Illich says this vision sounds idealistic _only because we haven’t yet built the tools to realize it._ He outlines three practical tasks:

#### (1) **Educate People About the Crisis**

- Create ways for more people to **understand the true nature of our ecological and social crisis**, and see why **limits and convivial living** are essential.
    

#### (2) **Empower Movements for Frugality**

- Support and expand **grassroots movements** that already demand simpler, more human-centered ways of life—and make sure members feel **satisfied and committed**, not marginalized.
    

#### (3) **Reclaim Legal and Political Tools**

- **Identify and revalue the legal and political mechanisms** that still exist in society, and **learn to use them** to support convivial living and protect emerging alternatives.




### **1. The Real Barrier: Political Myths, Not Lack of Information**

- The **main obstacle** isn’t that people don’t know what limits are needed.
    
- Nor is it that people are unwilling to accept limits—many would if they felt it was truly necessary.
    
- The **true obstacle** is the **power of political myths**, which distort how people and their interests are perceived.
    

> 🧠 _What stops change isn’t ignorance—it’s illusion._

---

### **2. Mythical Majorities Are Politically Paralyzing**

- In rich societies, most people are **complicit consumers** who, in some way, **harm the environment**.
    
- Political myths **transform this numerical fact into the idea of a unified voting bloc** that supports endless growth.
    
- This mythical bloc is **invoked by those in power** to shut down change: “We can’t stop growth—_they_ won’t allow it!”
    

> 🗳️ _But this majority doesn’t exist—only the myth does._

---

### **3. These “Majorities” Are Actually Individuals with Conflicting Interests**

- When you look closely, the people grouped together under this myth **don’t actually share the same goals**:
    
    - The **ecologist** who flies to a climate conference,
        
    - The **economist** trying to create jobs,
        
    - The **working-class consumer** in Detroit buying a TV.
        
- They are **individuals making compromises**, not a **cohesive political force** for growth.


There can be no such thing as a majority opposed to an issue that has not arisen. A majority agitating for limits to growth is as ludicrous a concept as one demanding growth at all cost. Majorities are not created by shared ideologies. They develop out of enlightened self-interest. 


Large institutions can quite suddenly lose their respectability, their legitimacy, and their reputation for serving the public good. It happened to the Roman Church in the Reformation, to Royalty in the Revolution. The unthinkable became obvious overnight: that people could and would behead their rulers.


- Today’s unemployment and breakdowns in production are being “solved” by **creating more jobs in decision-making, control, and therapy**—not in meaningful, productive work.
    
- Society still clings to **industrial ideals**, believing we can have **both limitless growth and ecological sustainability**.
    
- This obsession **blinds us** to the possibility of a **postindustrial society** with **diverse, balanced forms of production** (e.g., subsistence, craftsmanship, community care).

what is good enough for all.

### **The Right Tool for Transformation: Politics and Law**

- Illich argues that **only one kind of tool** can guide society through collapse toward renewal:
    
    - The **formal structure of politics and law**—not as bureaucracy, but as a shared process of decision-making among equals.
        

> ⚖️ _It’s not technology or ideology that will save us—it’s our capacity for fair, participatory political action._

---

### **2. Crisis Becomes Opportunity Only Through Collective Confidence**

- When the crash comes (an **industrial collapse**, not just economic), the outcome depends on whether a **new group of conscious citizens** can:
    
    - Inspire **trust and clarity** in others,
        
    - Help people **understand the crisis**, and
        
    - **Lead the use of political procedures** to reshape society.
        

> 🔁 _Collapse doesn’t automatically lead to renewal—it requires leadership rooted in democratic confidence._

---

### **3. Convivial Procedure: The Heart of a Just Transition**

- This new politics must:
    
    - **Acknowledge conflicting interests**,
        
    - Recognize the **historical roots of conflict**,
        
    - Accept **peer-based decisions** (not imposed rules).
        
- Such a **"convivial use" of procedure** ensures that:
    
    - The revolution doesn’t turn into **a new bureaucracy**,
        
    - Goals **emerge through action**, rather than being imposed from above.
        

> 🛠️ _It’s not about a blueprint, but about trusting process to guide purpose._

---

### **4. Labels Don’t Matter—The Process Does**

- Whether you call this transformation:
    
    - a **cultural revolution**,
        
    - **participatory socialism**,
        
    - the **recuperation of law**, or
        
    - a return to **local legal traditions** (like the _Fueros de España_),
        
    
    the label isn’t important.
    
- What matters is that **people reclaim the political process as their own**, and use it **consciously and cooperatively**.

## About Liberty

### **The Problem: Liberty Has Been Misunderstood**

- In both **capitalist** and **socialist** societies, liberty has been wrongly defined as the **right to use more powerful tools** without limits.
    
    - In capitalism: this means individuals or corporations claim unlimited rights to consume.
        
    - In socialism: the state claims the right to grow and produce endlessly.
        
- This misunderstanding has made it harder to recognize the **true political process**—one based on **limits, not endless growth**.


## Industrialization of Man


The convergence of corporate monopolies on the deep structural level of society can be called the industrialization of man. This trend must be inverted if people are to be free. But the industrial corruption of language itself makes this issue terribly difficult to formulate.

Of course, that competition can be organized either as a zero-sum game, in which one wins when another loses, or as a non-zero-sum game, in which both competitors get more than if either had lost. Compulsory school could be construed as an example of a zero-sum game: there are only winners and losers; by definition school bestows privilege on fewer people than it degrades. An example of the second would be the transition from private to public transport: at least for the time being, more commuters could get faster wherever they want to go.

What was at issue was control over the tools of production. Such were the events which brought the Marxists to power in Eastern Europe. But the crisis I have described as imminent is not a crisis within industrial society, but a crisis of the industrial mode of production itself The crisis I have described confronts people with a choice between convivial tools and being crushed by machines. The only response to this crisis is a full recognition of its depth and an acceptance of inevitable self-limitations. 

### **1. You Don’t Need a Unified Majority to Limit Institutions**

- People who support **limits on industrial systems** don’t need to share the same ideology.
    
- In a democracy, **majorities are often formed by people with very different reasons** for supporting the same action.
    

> 🗳️ _Political coalitions form around shared goals—not shared beliefs._

---

### **2. Example: Public School Opposition**

- People may oppose the school system for very different reasons:
    
    - They don’t have kids and resent paying taxes.
        
    - They feel their district is unfairly treated.
        
    - They prefer private or religious schooling.
        
    - They oppose compulsory education on moral or philosophical grounds.
        
- These groups **don’t form a party or movement**, but **together** they could vote to **reduce the size or power** of the school system.
    

> ✂️ _Such a vote may be conservative in effect—it shrinks the system, but also helps it survive in a more legitimate, limited form._

---

### **3. In Normal Times, Majorities Tend to Be Conservative**

- Under “business-as-usual” politics, even when people vote for limits, they often end up **preserving the institution**—just in smaller, more acceptable form.
    
- So even “cutting down to size” is not revolutionary; it’s **stabilizing**.
    

> 🧩 _Majorities don’t reshape systems during normal times—they adjust them._

---

### **4. But Crises Create a Different Kind of Majority**

- When **many institutions fail at once**—education, transport, health, justice—it becomes clear that **industrial society itself** is the problem, not just its parts.
    
- This kind of **deep systemic crisis** creates a chance for a **new majority**, one that sees through the whole illusion of infinite institutional growth.
    

> 🌪️ _Only when the system itself breaks down can people unite to build something truly different._


### **1. The Power of Law and Language, Even When Abused**

- Even in corrupt or unjust societies, where legal systems are:
    
    - **Restricted to the privileged**, or
        
    - **Used to justify authoritarianism** (e.g., show trials),
        
    
    the **appeal to law and formal procedure** still holds deep moral and symbolic power.
    
- This is especially true when it’s tied to **ordinary language** and **historical traditions** of a people.
    

> ⚖️ _The formal structure of justice—even when abused—still offers a way to speak truth and resist domination._

---

### **2. Speaking Through the “Word” Is a Revolutionary Act**

- Illich describes the **"word recovered from history"**—the shared, ordinary, communal use of language and procedure—as the **last, fragile, but potent tool** left to humanity.
    
- Even if revolutionaries **mock or dismiss** this kind of appeal, it remains the **most honest and powerful form of resistance**.
    
- Why? Because it can **unite people** and **transform inevitable violence** into **convivial reconstruction**—a rebuilding of society based on cooperation, limits, and meaning.

%% It will be disastrous if our language is also taken away by the tools %%
