> The premise to my argument can therefore be formulated as follows: relations of thinking and knowing require care.

> Caring and relating thus share conceptual and ontological resonance. In worlds made of heterogeneous interdependent forms and processes of life and matter, to care about something, or for somebody, is inevitably to create relation. In this way care holds the peculiar significance of being a ‘non normative obligation’ (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2010): it is concomitant to life – not something forced upon living beings by a moral order; yet it obliges in that for life to be liveable it needs being fostered.

> care obliges us to constant fostering, not only because it is in its very nature to be about mundane maintenance and repair, but because a world’s degree of liveability might well depend on the caring accomplished within it. In that sense, standing by the vital necessity of care means standing for sustainable and flourishing relations, not merely survivalist or instrumental ones.
## About care

The concept of _care_—a continuous _non normative obligation_ to look after and maintain a healthy state of others that will otherwise deteriorate—can be an interesting hint in designing human-technology relationship.

Care is repetitive, mundane, and concrete actions we undertake to maintain our world and its inhabitants.

In this interdependence, wellbeing of the object of care directly relates to the subject's wellbeing (physical, or mental). 

Puig de la Bellacasa broadens the horizons of caring to include “more than human” beings. With a hint of the Eastern worldview, I would happily add, it can include, mortal, and immortal, even something extending beyond our cognition.

Humans are innately malleable to project our sense of wellbeing into a different kind. Think about a piece of furniture that you sometimes wax and appreciate—Its well-maintained status becomes part of your happiness. Maria Puig de la Bellacasa studied the care for soil,[^1] that's so vastly interconnected with innumerous factors that we can only perceive a fraction of the aspects that we can do something about, hoping it will work, but always continuing to discover the other factors at play. The care of such a complex matter is, undeniably, a slow, full of trial and errors, not lacking sweat and tears, yet immensely rewarding process.

## Thinking-with-many

I am not the only one. Thinking-with makes the work of thought stronger, it supports its singularity and contagious potential.

Laugh with, not laughing at, comes from thinking embedded in communities one cares for, and it is an example of a form of thinking with care that I propose to call dissenting-within.
## Breaking down care: Ethopoietic process[^2]

| Ethopoietic process    | Key action that can be designed  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Daily maintenance      | Noticing                         |
| Emotional attachment   | Acting-on                        |
| Unobligated obligation | Co-presencing                    |
- In the phase after emotional attachment, there's a diminution of a sense of forced obligation and associated efforts, and the caring process is more likely to continue.
- Dirty, sweaty interaction might be just part of the deal. Think about caring for a patient, an animal, or a city street, it's impossible to neglect the importance of removing, cleaning up the waste so that the remaining part is healthy and well-maintained.
- Care is a two-way street, the carer also receives a sense of empowerment from the receiver. Biologically it may be explained in terms of an elevation of oxytocin.

## How we can design routine for care?

How we can might encourage people to take daily, practical, repetitive actions of care in their relationship with technology? It's the opposite of efficiency. Even if some parts can be automated, the remaining you can never automate—otherwise the entire concept of care disappears with the automation.
