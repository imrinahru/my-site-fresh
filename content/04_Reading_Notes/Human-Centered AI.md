> I always thought of the technology as serving human needs. I advocated for human–computer interaction, information visualization, and design thinking, with occasional excursions to challenge those who thought the goal of technology was to mimic or replace humans.

> Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders.
> Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design, No.7

> Human-Centered AI shows how to make successful technologies that amplify, augment, empower, and enhance human performance.
### Notes  
- how creative designers can imagine highly automated systems that preserve human control.
- hisbookproposesanewsynthesisin which AI-based intelligent algorithms are combined with human-centered thinking to make HCAI. T his approach will increase the chance that technology will empower rather than replace people.
- The new synthesis gives equal attention to human users and other stakeholders by raising the value of user experience design and by measuring human performance.
- serving human values such as rights, justice, and dignity, and supporting goals such as self-efficacy, creativity, responsibility, and social connections. [^1]
- HCAI systems are designed to be supertools which amplify, augment, empower, and enhance human performance. They emphasize humancontrol, while embeddinghighlevelsofautomationbywayofAI and machinelearning. Examples include digital cameras and navigation systems, which give humans control yet have many automated features.
- The new aspiration is to have high levels of human control AND high levels of automation.
- AI research, science and innovation, are both valuable, but researchers, developers, business leaders, and policy-makers will need to be creative in finding effective ways of combining them to benefit the users. There are four design metaphors that can be used to combine the two goals of AI research: 1) intelligent agents and supertools; 2) teammates and tele-bots; 3) assured autonomy and control centers; and 4) social robots and active appliances.
- In a flourishing automation-enhanced world, clear, convenient interfaces could let humans control automation to make the most of people’s initiative, creativity and responsibility.
