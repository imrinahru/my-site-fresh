## **Why This Meetup Mattered**

This event offered a rare and valuable space for reflecting on **how we live, create, and feel with AI technology**. Beyond technical advances, the speakers explored how _bodily experience, critique, and curiosity_ can guide the design of tools and systems that remain humane—and humane in their balanced design. It is also a rare occasion reserved only for students and the youths, who have the ability to raise pure, deep, difficult, and even scary concerns and questions that encouraged inspiring discussions. The meetup illuminated that even in the era of technology, **others and interdependence** remain as the ley for a better future.

## **Summary**

This interdisciplinary session featured two leading thinkers bridging engineering, media art, human science, and digital culture.

- **Yasuaki Kakehi** spoke about _Material Experience Design Lab_ which he leads, Creative Futurists Initiative with Sony, and how universities must foster environments where curiosity is encouraged (even with a critical mind).
    
- **Dominique Chen**, as the only "maker/tinkerer" in a Human Science department, delved into thoughts behind Nukabot that he's been improving for 5 years, the joy of actively growing own tools, the importance of process that's often ignored in modern world.  

Together, they explored how **technology, when critically engaged, can deepen rather than replace human sensibility**.

## **Extended Insights**

### 1. **Beyond Intelligence: Embodied, Material, and Microbial Knowledges**

- Kakehi described a future where **materials themselves participate in intelligence**—biosignals, fermentation, and responsive substances as co-creators.
    
- Chen emphasized **microbes and ecosystems** as models for **natural intelligence**, challenging anthropocentric and data-centric AI norms.
    

### 2. **Reclaiming Curiosity in an Age of Optimization**

- Both speakers critiqued how **goal-oriented output** culture undermines exploration.
    
- Universities should **protect spaces where the hands keep moving**—where not knowing is a strength, not a weakness.
    
- Chen’s concept of “interesting answers over correct ones” was echoed throughout.
    

### 3. **AI, Surprise, and the Value of Misalignment**

- While ChatGPT’s refinement has made it safe and polished, Chen noted it has **lost the thrill of unpredictability**.
    
- Creativity arises in **misalignments**—the “slippage” between user and system, between human and microbial collaborators.
    
- The idea of “intelligence” must expand to include **sensation, joy, confusion, and bodily improvisation**.
    

### 4. **Responsibility, Bias, and Shared Agency**

- AI systems function within **boundaries set by humans**, yet **who takes responsibility** when they fail is an open question.
    
- Kakehi compared AI's development to **nukadoko (fermentation beds)**—shaped by environment, aging, and user interaction. The joy lies in **shared, uncertain authorship**.
    
- Both speakers emphasized **designing technologies that don’t addict**, but **support autonomy and reflection**.
    

### 5. **Auto-ethnography and AI-Assisted Inquiry**

- Chen demonstrated how generative AI enhances **auto-ethnographic practice**: surfacing unnoticed patterns in our own diaries, behaviors, and data.
    
- The method becomes a **loop of noticing**—the human reflects, AI reframes, the human re-questions.

## **Q&A with Students**

The student questions revealed a generational tension:

- Many voiced anxiety over **AI’s encroachment** on creativity and identity.
    
- Others asked how to **build trust** in themselves when “everything can be made” by machines.
    
- One question addressed the **mental health impacts of algorithm-driven platforms**, to which Chen responded with sharp critique of companies like Meta and X (formerly Twitter), noting their **neglect of long-term user wellbeing**.

## **My Take**

This event offered not just information, but **a vocabulary and sensibility** for thinking-with-tech, not just about tech.

What stood out:

- The metaphor of AI as **fermented substance**, something to be nurtured, aged, and shaped with care.
    
- The call to **remain in process**, to resist premature optimization, and to keep space open for slowness, detour, and wonder.
    
- The insight that **intelligence isn't owned—it’s shared**, between microbes, materials, machines, and people.
    

In a moment where AI tools seem to do _everything_, this conversation helped me ask: _What is it that only I can feel? notice? imagine?_ And how might I keep that flame alive—without outsourcing it too soon?
