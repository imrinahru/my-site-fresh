## Overview  




## Key takeaways  

### Joichi Ito

#### Narrative of the East

In Western culture, monotheism underlines the attitudes towards technology: there is one God, then humans, and under the humans there are tools (now, technology, before, slaves).
In the East, there is more of a sense of living together with tools, rather than controlling. 

Capitalism, introduced from the West, operates through economic expansion. If there is no expansion, then it's death.
Japan has the ability to find a sense of purpose in life even without economic growth, with the maintenance of Ise Jingu, the craftsmanship, whose work has continued for generations without necessarily expansion.

#### Pure experience

> 経験するというのは事実其儘に知るの意である...たとえば、色を見、音を聞く刹那、未だこれが外物の作用であるとか、我がこれを感じているとかいうような考のないのみならず、この色、この音は何であるという判断すら加わらない前をいうのである。それで純粋経験は直接経験と同一である。自己の意識状態を直下に経験した時、未だ主もなく客もない、知識とその対象とが全く合一している。これが経験の最醇なる者である。
> 西田幾多郎　『善の研究』（1911年）ch.1 「純粋経験」

Do you believe that:
- you are only receiving information and the world is a simulation? or,
- you are here, having experiences that are completely different from any single person?

It's not hard to understand that, people holding the first belief would come to the conclusion that, AI can replace humans even without body/embodiment.
People who believe in pure experience won't buy into it. People experience differently, form different values, and see their own differences are not situationists.

#### What we can learn from tea ceremony
一期一会
和敬清寂
Harmony-Humility-Purity-Tranquility
利休、利から休む
We can learn many things from Rikyu.
He didn't manifest until around fifties, he suddenlt adopted bamboo as a flower vase. (mind the context in which bamboo was consumable item but never thought appropriate in a tea ceremony, where china, bronze were the norm) 
What was amazing is that once he did that, everyone jsut went " oh, of course". So it's a remarkable transformation.

Transformation means reading the current atmosphere of society and understanding all the systems that are happening now, then you can do something that's far-reaching and deeply transforamtive.

#### Toyota's Kaizen:

無駄、無理、斑をなくす
Reduce  waste, unevenness, and stress.
Reducing waste is a bit different from optimization.
Top down and bottom up coexists.
Top may decide why and what actions to take, but even if you apply the same rukes at another factoiry, they don't work on-site. 
The factory managers would spend the whole day o  the floor, watching everyone's movements, indentifying waste or inefficiencies, understanding how it works at this factory. it's not like a single road or path, but when you actually spend an entire day at each site, there are thibngs that tou only notice for the first time, things that emerge from the sense of presence you experience there.
So human experience on-site is as important as the top-down action list to achieve the best operation in world.

#### AI should not be about optimization


Learning from Toyota, AI should be a tool for reducing waste, unevenness, and stress,  but never total optimization.
One of the ideas, is to sandwich AI operation between our values, and human experience on-site. AI has no means to fully get any of those two.


### The Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi Rinpoche



#### Empire builders vs. Universe builders

By George Bernard Shaw
How the universe operates?
How to create wholesome relationship with it

#### Find a relevant question, not a valid question

> The question is not, can they reason? nor Can they talk? but, can they suffer." By Jeremy Bentham

Mimicking emotion is not, feeling the emotion.
Human life is dealing with suffering.
How can a machine understand human suffering? 
What we mean by saying machines are self-aware?
- Reductionist self-awareness
- Purposefulness

#### Move away from marketing slogans on democratising AI

We believed in technology utopia 30 years ago. 
After 30 years, Internet is not democratic, in terms of infrastructure
The game of AI development is skewed: 7 companies are controlling the research and resources already
Even startups have aspirations to be acquired. A wonderful exercise of empire building
Is democratization working in current framework? No.

#### Challenge to democratic value

Civic values: Trust-Compassion-Kindness-Fearlessness-Respect-Dignity
We at least try to instill these values in us, and our children
But we don't have good template to be ethical, we only have ok template for compliance.
Ethical framing may subsume legality and compliance, but what is ethical may not be legal, what is legal may not be ethical.

Large employment rate, mental illness rate, that's what we should look into.

#### Ignorance is pervasive

We tend to conflate expertise with omniscience. 
Experts by defnition are adepts in narrowness of thinking tied to a particular domain.
But that's how our engineers, scientist expertes,  are trained. With echochamber, policy makers, the powerful as well.
Reach disillusionment first, then enlightenment.

#### Do we have a sensible narrative of AI? that we can relate to?

> Universe is made up of stories, not atoms Muriel 

We will sit on a couch, entertain and do nothing more.

#### Zen frankness

The pendulum is swinging from techno-optimism to where we are right now. But bhudist optimism is, this too shall pass, but we need to take charge of it.

### Robert Bench MIT Media Lab

#### About Incentives
Why are we driven to do something? both conscious and sub
How has the past 30 years of opennet dev and value system has caused us to change our rela
man in charge of machines to machine driving the time of men
Origin
In 90s, funded by govenment, MIT DOD can fund themselve
In mid 90s, we imagined medium of exchange would pay for data and compute
HTTP 402 is meant ro serve payment on the open internet failure of micropayments
Commercial use of internet was then run by Subsciption models failed. (AOL, Prodigy)
Pay walls are attempted by NY Times, but struggled.
What persisted was advertising based internet

Google, Meta, are ad platform in their core
Sale ad, need data, need your time
You in service to the machine

> Charlie Munger, if you show me the incentive, I will show you the outcome


![[attention economy_robert bench.png]]

#### Attention to attention

Attention means a different thing in AI age.
2017 Attention is all you need paper by Google, neural network attention. 

- Power by Tepco/Dominion
- Data centers run by Goolge, Microsoft, AWS
- New chips by Nvidia
- AI agent and new ways to experience the Interneyt by Anthropic OpenAI 

no longer swipes, eyeballs, clicks likes are eroding, so who pays for Google

Agents will be the de facto interface for the user

![[structure agent_robert bench.png]]


Agents are empowered to act, to sense, but can't incentivise themselves to do so.
Find ways to send adevertising to sell to AI
Advertising sales will continue, find ways to work, much to detriment to our time.
If advertising still serves the agentic internet.
Men in service of machine, more powerful machine, at a cost of our time

#### Stable coin


![[structure stablecoin_robert bench.png]]

Stable coin Value system does not need intermediary.
But Agents will be same number as API call in open internet
Stable coins are too slow and expensive to be a medium of exchange to replace ads

#### Can we scale stable coin network?
Radius  main goal
Structured like TCP/IP, more needs will icnrease speed and lower cost and faster
The only way to replace ads is to have a medium of exchange that scales with internet

To change incentive system, 
we need a stable coin network that uses internet, millions of transaction, have latency less then the current system

#### Men must in control of out time

We must remove ourselves from ads based internet
to buy our time back literally

### Eric Lagier

Be educated to become a shepherd,
taking care of the sheeps
vs
Be educated as wolves
Eats as many sheep as possible before found

learn from nordic 
as a small region,
Think global from day one
Define the category, not new fetures

#### Lovable

Started from GPT enginerr
AI softeware engineer, lovable makes it possible to build high quality softeware without writing code.
Anyone can write code now. 

### Ujjwal Deep Dahal

Trying to help, have a place in the the AI landscape, but lack of autonomous, active research, want collaboration, make people come, but don't know if it can work.
