## Follow-ups
### Residency opportunity
https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/artist-residencies-open-calls/
I have both Chinese and Japanese background. 
I am inspired by ethnological works such as The Mushroom at the End of the World around that views global precarity through different, multicultural lens.
I have great interest in keep looking into Japanese/Chinese conception of the world and practices, and how it can be a precious lens to see our global precarious moments.
How to research in-situ?

## Follow-ups

### Research theme
My interest in digital futures started out from creative coding and fablab communities (as well as zine).

I am interested in AI open-source, democratization policy making, along with actual coding and visualization. 

In that sense, I may not want to work as a UX designer designing product for others, I want to be a maker-consumer and impart that experience to others.

To be more concrete, in this 2 years, I want to experiment with a range of AI and ALife models. 

I think the word "AI" is in a hype and it now mainly means LLMs. 

But I think it is too powerful in many cases that cause more harm to users than empowering them (not a convivial tool in Illich's word). 

However, AI's definition has shifted and there were many other ways of designing calculation based solutions that benefit users. 

Another important point I want to explore is the long-standing division between AI and ALife. 

In my research framework I want to integrate both components to overcome human-centric understanding of intelligence and actively reference more-than-human intelligence.

~~**I want to put into practice and propose this overarching recipe book to a wider audience.**~~
(Summarization may not suffice as creation, although the learning experience and documentation of doing it from scratch can be useful.
Instead of covering all different methods of model-making, may as well **find a situated case to work out my idea, concretize it**)

What I can think of to integrate the system and policy making component in my final thesis?

# My thoughts

Empowerment is an underlying concept, regardless of the subject, which can be human, or non-human.

Empowerment means to make apparent the intrinsic quality of a material.

Create and change with a specific case.
Don't be satisfied with leaning or summarizing the knowledge.

Create for a specific needs, in the flow, in the real, here and now, together.
