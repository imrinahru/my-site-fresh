> *Model Cards are files that accompany the models and provide information about the model, its intended uses and potential limitations (including ethical considerations), training parameters and experimental information, datasets used for training and evaluation results. This ensures that the models uploaded to the hub are transparent and open to the community.*

### Notes  
- Model card is a comprehensive, neutral (as much as possible) note on a model, that includes
	- Model description
	- Intended uses & limitations
	- How to use
	- Limitations and bias
	- Training data
	- Training procedure
	- Evaluation results
- As a UXUI designer (or anyone familiar with frontend development), it reminds of a well-documented component spec that facilitates component usage and continued improvement by everybody.


### Relevance to AI Commons  
- The concept of model card is essential for everybody to have a shared understanding, and a starting point to interact with the model.
