> *Model Cards are files that accompany the models and provide information about the model, its intended uses and potential limitations (including ethical considerations), training parameters and experimental information, datasets used for training and evaluation results. This ensures that the models uploaded to the hub are transparent and open to the community.*

## Notes 

- Model card is a comprehensive, neutral (as much as possible) description on a model, that includes
	- Model description
	- Intended uses & limitations
	- How to use
	- Limitations and bias
	- Training data
	- Training procedure
	- Evaluation results
	
- As a UX/UI designer—or anyone with experience in front-end development—it reminds me of a well-documented _component spec_ that makes it easy for everyone to use and improve the component over time.
