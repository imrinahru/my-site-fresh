> *Democratizing Good ML 🤗*

## Notes  

- Around 2022, there was a greater sense of mission for AI democratization, ethical development and societal good, manifested in spaces, organization, project and channel created at that time.
- As of 2025 June, most of the spaces related to ethical experimentation/scrutiny are no longer running.

- ~~Updating and maintaining the ethics related spaces, such as examination, benchmarking tools, can be a valid starting point.~~
(Updated July 1, 2025: Ethics and values are among the most difficult things humans can precisely agree on ([[New Context Conference 2025 Summer]], Tenzin). Based on this assumption, focusing on actual, experiential product that can naturally instil self-reflection, and alignment with ethics, should be prioritised.)
