> *Democratizing Good ML 🤗*

### Notes  
- Around 2022, there was a greater sense of mission for AI democratization, ethical development and societal good, manifested in spaces, organization, project and channel created at that time.
- As of 2025 June, most of the spaces related to different aspects of ethics are no longer running.
- The spaces do not support navigation/filter with ethical topics.

### Relevance to AI Commons  
- Updating and maintaining the ethics related spaces, such as examination, benchmarking tools, can be a valid starting point.
