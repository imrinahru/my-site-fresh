## Context  

While technology is changing fast, I have been feeling a sense of isolation from the tools and work itself as a UX designer. That seemed like a strange feeling at first, since there were already so many tools to choose from, and there would likely be more in the following days and weeks. It's also more than possible to change jobs, do a different product or service.

However, it felt like such a long and unnatural slump, that was underlying everything I did. Although I have to note that, this deeper layer of struggle was at first buried under other exploitative factors in the workplace, and rose up into my conscience only recently. In the end, I could not bring myself to find a new product to devote to, and instead spent my remaining saving to jump into a Master's degree in something digital that's intentionally vague and open-ended.

I wanted to use the 2-year time that I bought for myself, to redesign how to work, from the tools to start with, ground up, to the context in which it's done everyday, for the past decade, and likely for the remaining of my lifetime.

In addition, I'd like to think of myself as one of the thousands and millions of labourers facing the same reality. Some are well-off than others, and I'm grateful for my past-experience in a established car manufacturer, and then a fast-growing apparel, that unintentionally gave me a first-hand experience covering industrialized, marketing-driven design, to digitally-driven, de-materialized design. This experience allowed me to see, albeit partially, where we came from: a time of rising material abundance, optimistic globalization; to our current point in time: virtuality and experience over goods, more inequality and relative poverty, more acute realization of unsustainability, all happening in a technology-driven world that have both lights and shadows.

While I was struggling with my relationship with digital products and the working culture generally, generative AI enters the scene and adds a new dimension of challenge. I'm even inclined to say that it has transformed my struggle to something I have never expected before. Since 2022, it suddenly has the potential to change every aspect of common people's work and life. At current trend, it only seemed that AI will exacerbate the sense of isolation and meaninglessness in modern labour. 

So my goal here is to outlie my current understanding of how AI has affected our work (mainly design) as of 2025, and land on a rough action plan to look into an alternative context and tools for the future. 


## What is work (in an age of AI)?


Take design and designer as a case in point.

A designer comprehends and thinks (experiential transformation) through the act of sketching, creating, and talking to (real) users. AI should not replace the activities that bring experiential transformation to the designer. In this sense, user research should not be replaced by "AI agent" research because ultimately, we care the users: we care, therefore we design. (I raised this specific case because this is exactly what a company I know is looking to do.)

In addition, in order to feel the ownership and be able to do the work, the person should be able to plan and modify their workflows. This is because people approach their work differently: some put emphasis on A, and delegate B, while others emphasize B, and automate C. That difference comes down to different intrinsic values of the work performed by different people (not market values, although the different intrinsic values would translate into different output, and hence, different market values.) 

People are more than ever required to reflect on their unique intrinsic values at work. In other words, what you like and dislike, what you care as a human being (The word, "work", here, definitely inherits Illich's definition of work, instead of the common, oftentimes much broader definition) .

## How AI affects design work?


AI should act in the same way as creative tools that extend designers' ability.

For a car designer, in the past, the main tools were: pen, paper, and clay. Sometimes rulers, different brush. Then in my time, there came digital brush, 3D scan, 3D modeling, and real-time rendering. Although I disliked Adobe and would have rather studied using pastel for gradations, here's an example where technological advancement does not necessarily alienate people: Through digital transformation, some designers could now directly start from 3D modeling, instead of traditional sketches. The prevalence of 3D modeling tools, such as Rhinoceros, Fusion 360 and Blender provided a new workflow options that were previously unavailable.

These tools share the attributes of:
- allowing easy start
- not requiring complex/dependent processes
- allowing open-ended use cases
- allowing easy modification (even misuse)


So now, how did AI come into the design process ?

Looking across the table, I cannot help but think that, although efficiency ((quality+quantity)/time) is welcomed, how much intrinsic value of the process, experience, and sometimes, interactions we are prepared to lose for that?

If we are delegating a part of creation process to AI, then by definition and design, our own process, and hence source of experience, is reduced. However, if we can increase the total volume and richness of our experience through the use of AI, then the above observation can be refuted. In other words, if using AI helps us going further and deeper in our work, which expands our experiential journey and its depth, then the use of AI won't incur the negativity listed above.

Looking across the Internet, many creators of different backgrounds have already incorporated AI in their process. Some of the common examples are:

### Vibing

All the process is initiated by AI. The creator may have a vague vision of the end result but never clarified. The creator is in service of the AI to go through and finish the necessary steps of design. The role of AI and the creator is reversed, so that AI becomes a creator, and the creator, a manager. 

Vibing may sound fun and worry-free in the initial instance, however, it may also be a frustration-filled experience for people who have some experience in the traditional contents creation. The frustration comes from lots of unguaranteed trials that people sometimes refer to as Gacha. Unsatisfied with a single service, people try across different service providers, spend more time discussing about and comparing different AI generative services, instead of focusing on the act of creation itself. 

The practice may not be sustainable in the long run. However, with time, people may naturally transition to the following category: experimenting with AI itself.

### Experimenting

AI is but another creative material that has its own personality. A designer can experiment with brush stroke the same way as experimenting with AI generated results. The interest hereafter lies in AI itself. A creator of this category may as well be identified as an AI creator, rather than its original role.

I'd first and foremost think of Yves and  in this category.

### Automating

Part of the tedious, time-consuming process that the creator feels little attachment is handed over to AI to automate and speedup. Such as verifying if the design is not a 2D illusion when placed in 3D, or that the design works as intended when used in actual environment. The evaluation and decision-making role are reserved to the human creator.

Some of the work is too repetitive and detailed, that we pretty much have a clear idea of what we want as the final result, but it just takes long time for us to reach the end. In the past, we suppressed our inner voice to do this tasks for a living (it even helped us consuming our long working hours to some extent). In a freer working environment, people should pick up their instinctive refusal of this kind of jobs that are clearly not meant for human, identify them, and decisively assign these to machines.

### Sounding board

AI is used to fill in what the creator didn't think of, other possibilities, a surprising suggestion from another. However, it's getting increasingly clear that we cannot count on AI to provide us surprising suggestion. In the past, people without previous knowledge expected the unexpectedness, which is only due to low accuracy and hallucination. Some would express their nostalgic feeling toward initial AI models. However it's questionable how much value we should give to a hallucinating content generated by AI, who doesn't have any meaningful idea about what it pronounces. It's value is entirely supported by the active receiver, which is us, the human creators, who can attach meanings to the generated contents and find it inspiring.

### Expanding

A bit relating to automating, as it still involves changing the already existing design vision into another relevant format, but in a way bridging the gap between the design domain and other specialists. 

In cases where non-coders can change design visuals to working prototypes with vibe-coding, the designer has the potential to think from a working prototype instead of traditional static sketch. With careful observation and trials, the designer is exposed to more coding and development world. The experience is hence augmented and the designer empowered.

Some also emphasized the usefulness of AI in terms of lowering the floor of new knowledge domains. Mediated by AI, people no longer need to start from 0 and build-up their knowledge reading the whole book, or following the entire course. Instead, people with urgent, pin-point needs can use AI to extract and adapt the knowledge in a digestible format for them to consume easily.  

## Other works of life

Looking beyond design, any professional domain can be plotted along the spectrum of power domination between tools and humans. If I stand in face of this spectrum horizontally laid out, with tools controlling us on the left side and more human control on the right side, any single intersection of my glance across the spectrum is a potential, possible, parallel society that upholds that level of balance. For instance, at the 20 : 80 point of the spectrum, tools are 4 times more dominating us, at least in this theoretical space. I, as an individual, could have been born in any one of this parallel world, and worked according to the power balance determined there.





This speculative diagram opens up our mind to a different societal context that could be possible. Each individual, me, you, Dave across the hall, we all potentially possess a spectrum of all these options respectively. Each individual would likely have a different sweet spot across the spectrum. It doesn't stop here. Each individual can potentially have any numbers of these spectrums, depending on the numbers of roles one is open to in this world. So the me_designer may want 60% human control, while me_marketer may want 40% human control, depending on what I like and dislike, what I care and don't care. It directly reflects my world view. 

In current society, it's already common for people to have multiple job titles across life, so it's even more reasonable for each individual to think across one's roles—how much control should be kept in one role, while how much control can be delegated in another, so that as a whole, the person is maximizing the potential, satisfaction, and enjoyment as a human being. When the tool in this case is AI, we can use the diagram to start thinking about and visualizing our relationship with AI in multiple aspects of our life. 

Moreover, I want to emphasize that the roles that I refer to is not limited to professions. It includes any role that we undertake across our life time: a student, a parent, a caregiver, a habitant. Current social context values professions that have economic values, but historically devalued other activities that were difficult to attach market values, but nonetheless with unreplaceable intrinsic values. If we try to think about a different possible social context, it's important to recognize this bias in the first place. In a world where the environment suffers from our uncontrolled economic greed, I think it's exactly these undervalued activities such as care that uphold the valuable insights in how we should redefine our relationship with work.

With this thought process in mind, my preference diagram may look something like this: 





Going beyond the individual diagram, people with similar social roles in the society as a collective, also has an ideal power balance between AI (tool) and human input. Since as a practitioner of a similar activity, there is more often than not, a shared understanding of the enjoyment and struggle. The collective diagram may be plotted close to the average of aggregated preferences. So a collective diagram may look something like this: 



The question then falls down to, in our case, what is the preferred collective diagram that applies to our current society. And so more importantly, how can we measure the personal preference of each individual? In order to do that, the most crucial use cases to define are around the edges of tool-dominance meeting human-dominance. One way of telling a person's preference in a specific domain, is to offer the edge use case where tool dominance is increased step-by-step, until a point where, passing that point is no longer desirable for the person in question.

The difficulty lies in, even if the tool-human power balance is roughly the same, there are likely to be multiple possible designs to achieve that balance. Yet, due to individual subtle preference, some may pass the bar while others may not. In this sense, a variety of design concepts should be tried and tested. And there needs to be a clear definition (as much as possible) of how each design corresponds to a point in tool-human scale.




## Bringing contextual change to work

HCI designers have the ability to make sure that the tools are empowering people, that they stay in the limits within the first and second threshold as described by Illich. The key is the design of the tool, instead of the technology behind it. Technology can be as powerful as it could, but the design needs to make sure it is empowering people, instead of controlling them.

At the same time, designers have a long history of serving the Capitalism. Like the designer in Mad Man. A car designer follows business-driven cycles of minor and full model change and works out new designs that can stimulate more and more demand.

It is high time designers realize how much we are incorporated into the Capitalist system that's perpetuating the user-designer division. At the same time, I'm speaking for myself but hopefully also for many fellow designers, that by doing so, we also feel a distance to our own design, that we are but a tool for more clicks, more scrolls, and more profitability. 

Creating a tool that empowers the users, will in turn empower the designers. But a tool that empowers the users does not necessarily makes money and drives business expansion. It is likely to be shared and contributed by the users, and it embraces user autonomy, instead of dependence.

I think the problem of Capitalism can only be overcome internally. Users vote through purchase and usage. If there are common digital tools that are open and free for anyone, that are better than centrally managed, charged options, then the market will eliminate the latter, until the time comes, when new business opportunity is found by another company.

So continuous improvement and evolution are necessary to maintain the digital tools in good condition. In order to do so, there needs to be a social structure where designers can be involved in these roles continuously.

Freelancing offers a way to earn a living while working with profit-driven companies, gaining firsthand exposure to the advanced technologies and products they develop to shape markets and influence behavior. At the same time, it provides an opportunity to redirect some of that knowledge, experience, or benefit back into the commons.

It is one of the working style I can think of that can reduce inequality, and enhance sustainability. However, does that mean that the designers need to voluntarily give up some of their earning for the Pro Bono project?

Even the Linux Foundation relies on profit-driven companies to be members and offer resources in order to start even a sandbox project. There is politics of give-and-take at work here. Especially, open source can be a great source of innovation. Thanks to many decades of engineers, scientist, and designers believing in the democratization of the Internet, the digital fabrication, the data, and the now the AI models and agents, the open-source communities have strong ground, connections and appeals already. And a contribution of a single person can be small, but it is the power of the community to be able to multiply that by thousands and millions of contributors to create something greater than any one organization can achieve. Think of Wikipedia. 

The most important is to expand the base population who can contribute, no matter how small, but constantly, and with positive sentiment of ownership and care.


## A design mock idea for us



### Conclusion

Recently, an AI company CEO suggested, as more and more work is effectuated by AI, they started to gain different perspectives. A task in which humans play an active role, even if some parts are delegated to AI, can be validated or modified at later steps. However, when a task has no more active involvement of humans, it incurs costs to the company in the middle- and long-run as nobody on the team has neither the initiative nor the knowledge to undertake the black-boxed task again. So even profit-driven companies would agree with my approach of empowering people at least to a certain extent. But beyond that point of agreement, how should we reconciliate? 

![[Pasted image 20250722002441.png]]

If the company owners are only interested in making money button, then once there is an AI that can reflect and correct their course of action, and provide results that surpass anything done by human, then is there any reason to keep any human employees?
