## TL;DR  
*Two-sentence executive summary.*

## Context  

The following remarks and slogans are increasingly making me feel unease:

> - **AI Scientists** who keep exploring and making discoveries around the clock
> - **AI Artists** who create new kinds of music, art, and stories we’ve never seen before
> - **AI Engineers** who design buildings, spaceships, and even new types of computers
> - **AI Teachers** who help every student learn in the way that works best for them
> - **AI Doctors** who find new treatments and maybe even help people live longer
> A blogger 

> There won't be enough people, so we need AI to fill up.
> An AI startup aiming to provide digital workforces for enterprise

> AIファーストで、人々が「人生」に使える時間をつくる
> An AI startup aiming to provide digital workforces for enterprise

The CEO of this startup also revealed in an interview:

> (...) one years, two years in future half 50% AI do. AIs provide new resource to client. Don’t notice client. (correction: Clients don't notice)
> Human have mistake. AI is a not have mistake. We can train AI and not do a same mistake. AI can’t lie.

> That is too philosophical for me to answer. (An AI researcher interested in continuous-learning AI, in response to my question on how we should live with it)


## Main argument  

Instead, we need a balance, a _co-presence_ between human-being and AI agent.

It's like a delicate symbiosis of nature. If gone too far, mutualism would turn into a form of parasitism, the transition is out-of-sight yet exponential. It would be too late to notice when the host already ceded its dominant seat (more likely, the host may no longer have the capacity to notice at this stage). 

Recently there have been a rise in what I saw as a drive towards "AI first".
