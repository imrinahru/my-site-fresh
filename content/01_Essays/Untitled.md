## TL;DR  
*Two-sentence executive summary.*

## Context  

> - **AI Scientists** who keep exploring and making discoveries around the clock
> - **AI Artists** who create new kinds of music, art, and stories we’ve never seen before
> - **AI Engineers** who design buildings, spaceships, and even new types of computers
> - **AI Teachers** who help every student learn in the way that works best for them
> - **AI Doctors** who find new treatments and maybe even help people live longer

> There won't be enough people, so we need AI to fill up
> An AI startup aiming to provide digital workforces for enterprise

> AIファーストで、人々が「人生」に使える時間をつくる

> Human have mistake. AI is a not have mistake. We can train AI and not do a same mistake. AI can’t lie.
> An AI startup aiming to provide digital workforces for enterprise
