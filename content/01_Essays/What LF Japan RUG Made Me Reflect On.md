## What this is about

Attending the Japan Regional User Group (RUG) meetup, hosted by the Linux Foundation AI & Data, gave me more than just technical updates—it offered a moment to reflect on where I stand in the rapidly evolving world of open-source AI. As someone still finding my footing in this space, the event surfaced both inspiration and discomfort: a sense of shared purpose, but also a reminder of how distant the tools and practices can still feel. This post gathers some of those reflections, drawn not just from the presentations but from the candid conversations that followed.

## My reflection

As someone coming to this topic from outside computer science, I’ve followed the technical and strategic arguments for open-source with great interest. But my personal concern is more basic: as technology grows more complex, it’s becoming less accessible to ordinary users. AI, in particular, is still messy and malleable—making this a crucial moment to bring it back within reach.

After all, the internet didn’t grow on its own. We’ve all contributed to shaping it, even passively, just by existing online. Yet many people now feel sidelined, while a small group of actors determine how its most powerful tools—especially AI—are built and used.

We shouldn’t live in a world where the technologies shaping how we work, communicate, and make decisions feel closed off to most of us. I want to help build a world where people can use and understand AI—and, if they choose, help improve it—in a way that’s sustainable and empowering.

But where to begin?

I appreciated the practical advice [[#Join the GenAI Commons Community]] shared by the speakers at the event, and some conversation with the participants afterward helped clarify a few things:

- Usability is a major bottleneck in open-source. Designers and non-technical users have a real role to play in making tools more accessible.
    
- Regulation is important, but real products, stories, and live demos often change minds more effectively.
    
- As AI-native computing and composite-AI systems take shape, design can help make them transparent and usable—not just to developers, but to everyone. Without that, A2A-style architectures risk becoming black boxes layered on top of black boxes that distance people from the technology.

I’m certainly feeling that distance myself: Switching to Linux takes immense mental effort; Failing to complete an IBM Coursera course on AI as I stuck on the terminal-based exercises.

That's after hours of searching GitHub issues and Reddit threads, hoping someone had the same problem. Each error seemed to depend on some obscure factor. The tools didn’t explain themselves, and the information online—though abundant—was scattered and often assumed a higher level of expertise. 

Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot helped me make more progress (ironically proprietary), but only to a point. If the first suggestion didn’t solve the issue, subsequent attempts often led nowhere. This was especially true when using the command line. And each time I hit a dead end, I worried: what if I can’t get past this? (#vibecodingsyndrome, anyone can relate?)


## Why documenting the process matters

These kinds of experiences aren’t often voiced. Some people might feel these are too basic to ask, or that it’s their responsibility to figure things out on their own. Others may never even entered the scene. And those who do become fluent in the tools may forget what the early struggle felt like.

So it meant something to hear it stated plainly: “Isn’t Linux hard to use?” It is—and simply hearing that acknowledged made the experience feel a little less isolating.

Another point has stayed with me: “Try to remember what’s difficult now. Because if you stay in this space long enough, you’ll stop noticing and that distance from others will grow.”

That’s part of why I’ve written this—not just to recap what I learned, but to record the learning process itself. For others who might be on a similar path, and as a reminder to myself later on. Paying attention to where the friction lies might be one of the most valuable contributions I can make.
