# TA Preparation & Teaching Framework

## 1. Role of a TA

TAs are not responsible for introducing **new content**.  
Your role is to **facilitate learning** — helping students engage deeply with lecture materials and assigned readings.

Think of your tutorial as a **study group**, where students:

- Develop critical thinking skills
    
- Explore course material in depth
    
- Prepare for assignments and tests
    
- Support one another through shared learning strategies and community building
    

### Modes of Facilitation

**Synchronous (live tutorials):**

- Lead discussions on lecture content
    
- Summarize and clarify key ideas
    
- Prompt students to explain or apply specific readings/themes
    

**Asynchronous (online engagement):**

- Share reading prompts or reflective questions
    
- Post-lecture surveys to gauge understanding
    
- Provide feedback on discussion boards
    
- Curate extra resources or clarifications
    
**SAS Status**

    - Setting up calendar invites for tutorials?
        
    - Managing discussion boards or announcements?
        
    - Maintaining a tutorial channel in Teams?
        
- **Accommodations:**
    
    - You may not automatically receive SAS accommodation emails.
        
    - Ask the instructor if there are students with accommodations relevant to your TA role.
        
- **Resources & Materials:**
    
    - Clarify access to lecture notes and readings.
        
    - Confirm whether any handouts or guides you create require faculty approval before sharing.
        
- **Grading:**
    
    - Determine whether grading is shared or independent.
        
    - Clarify:
        
        - Turnaround time for grades
            
        - Who inputs grades into Canvas
            
        - Whether faculty approval is needed before releasing grades
            
    - Confirm how to handle grade complaints (process/formality).
        
- **Issues & Escalation:**
    
    - Procedure for notifying faculty if you must cancel a tutorial
        
    - Boundaries for handling extensions, conflicts, or distressed students
        
    - Protocol for suspected plagiarism or re-mark requests
        
- **Communication & Check-ins:**
    
    - Establish frequency and method of check-ins with faculty
        
    - Confirm preferred form of address (Dr., Prof., First name)
        

---

## 3. Professional Practice as TA

- Use formal tone in emails; listen carefully and respond thoughtfully in conversations.
    
- Reinforce lecture content through:
    
    - In-class tutorial activities (typically in the latter 30 minutes)
        
    - Experiential and discussion-based exercises
        
    - Short summaries or mini-presentations
        
- Maintain consistency and responsiveness — ensure students feel heard.
    
- Use repetition to reinforce learning; familiarity builds confidence.

# Week7: The Changing Nature of Artistic Work and Identity

### 1. **Uncertainty and Precarity in the Cultural Sector**

Cultural organizations and artists alike face significant uncertainty.

- **Organizations** manage this by adopting project-based structures, using short-term contracts to stay flexible and reduce overhead (Storey, Salaman, & Platman, 2005).
    
- **Artists**, in turn, manage instability—marked by unemployment and underemployment—through multi-job careers, continuous learning, and maintaining broad social networks to access opportunities (Bridgstock, 2005; O’Mahony & Bechky, 2006; Throsby & Zednik, 2011).
    
- The art world is marked by **oversupply, project-based work, and unpredictability**, where success often appears accidental (Bielby & Bielby, 1994; Menger, 1999).
    

> **Key idea:** Both institutions and artists cope with precarity through flexibility, diversification, and reputation-building.

---

### 2. **From Romanticism to Cultural Industries**

Historically, artists positioned themselves as **rebels** outside the market economy (Røyseng, Mangset, & Borgen, 2007). Yet over time, cultural production has become industrialized:

- In the 20th century, art shifted **from studio craft to corporate production**, supported by national markets and new technologies (Adorno & Horkheimer, 1944; Becker, 1984).
    
- Becker (1984) highlights the **specialization** of late-20th-century art worlds, exemplified by the extensive credits in film production.
    
- American elites institutionalized cultural prestige through **nonprofit high-culture institutions**—museums, orchestras, and theaters—reinforcing class hierarchies and separating “high” from “popular” art (DiMaggio, 1982).
    

However, these distinctions are breaking down: consumers increasingly exhibit **“omnivorous” tastes**, appreciating both elite and popular art (Peterson & Kern, 1996).

> **Key idea:** The historic divide between art and commerce has eroded, creating hybrid forms of production and taste.

---

### 3. **Artists as Economic Drivers**

Governments now frame artists as **key contributors to economic growth** and innovation in the post-industrial, global economy (Florida, 2012; Howkins, 2002).

- Cultural and creative industries are viewed as vital to GDP, prompting policies to **nurture creative talent** (DCMS, 2006, 2008).
    
- The **NEA’s recent shift** reframes artists explicitly as “workers” who create economic as well as cultural value (Iyengar, 2013).
    

> **Key idea:** Artists are now positioned as central to the “creative economy,” blurring lines between art, work, and entrepreneurship.

---

### 4. **Portfolio Careers and Hybrid Skill Sets**

Modern artistic careers are **protean and multi-directional** (Hall, 2004; Inkson, 2006).

- Success depends on **meta-competencies**: creative versatility, commercial acumen, and cross-platform fluency (Bridgstock, 2011; McRobbie, 2004b).
    
- Many artists willingly **work across roles and disciplines**, and interdisciplinary art programs are among the most popular today (Throsby & Zednik, 2011; Fendrich, 2005).
    
- Bridgstock (2005) describes a shift from **employment security to employability**, emphasizing adaptable, multi-skilled workers.
    

> **Key idea:** Artists now sustain themselves through flexible, multi-skill “portfolio careers” that balance creativity with pragmatism.

---

### 5. **Socially Engaged and Community-Oriented Practices**

Recent scholarship identifies a growing trend toward **social engagement** in artistic work:

- Many artists see themselves not just as creators but as **educators, social workers, and community actors** (Lena & Cornfield, 2008; Simonds, 2013).
    
- The tradition of the **“teaching artist”** has deep roots, from Jane Addams’s Hull House to contemporary arts education (Rabkin, 2013).
    
- **Social practice art** blurs the boundaries between activism, performance, and community organizing—often outside traditional art institutions (Kennedy, 2013).
    

Yet, this field faces institutional challenges: most artists lack training for social work, and funders are not equipped to support hybrid art–social initiatives (Brown & Tepper, 2012).

> **Key idea:** Artists are redefining their role as socially engaged collaborators, though existing institutions lag behind in support structures.

---

### 6. **Precarity and the Post-Fordist Economy**

Artists are often portrayed as **casualties of post-Fordist capitalism**—bearing economic risks once absorbed by employers (Bain & McLean, 2013; McRobbie, 2002).  
They self-fund education, juggle multiple jobs, and lack stable benefits, embodying the ideal of the **flexible, self-managing worker**.

> **Comment:** Either artists march alongside post-Fordist capitalism (as successful entrepreneurs) or become its exploited subjects (as precarious laborers).

> **Key idea:** Artists epitomize both the freedom and the precarity of contemporary flexible labor.

---

### 7. **Entrepreneurship, DIY Culture, and Technological Tools**

A shift is occurring where **individual creators hire capital**—outsourcing management, production, and promotion services to realize self-directed projects.

> **Comment:** Is this broadly true, or limited to a few success stories (e.g., generative coding communities)?

The **“New DIY”** ethos (Billboard, July 6 issue) celebrates artists as self-contained production units—recording, distributing, promoting, and selling directly via digital platforms (Nagy, 2013).

> **Comment:** Reflects the rise of personal creative autonomy and parallels trends in open-source AI and local model development.

> **Key idea:** New technologies enable artists to become “personal factories,” managing their own creative production from concept to market.

---

### 8. **Navigating the Center and Periphery**

Many “off-center” artists build careers **translocally**, maintaining connections to global networks while strengthening local scenes.  
They must balance **specialization and generalist skills, autonomy and collaboration, artistic ideals and commercial realities**.  
Cornfield (in press) argues that artists are **catalysts of innovation**, creating new professional identities and market niches (Baker & Faulkner, 1991).

> **Key idea:** Contemporary artists integrate disparate domains—economic, social, geographic—to sustain practice and community.

---

### 9. **Community, Collaboration, and Entrepreneurial Creativity**

Cornfield’s forthcoming book _Agents of a Changing Art World_ explores **entrepreneurial artists building communities** through businesses and nonprofits that support others (career development, legal, and policy advocacy).  
This collaborative entrepreneurship raises key questions:

- Who supports artists as they experiment?
    
- Where does community now reside?
    

> **Key idea:** Entrepreneurial artists are rebuilding community infrastructures within an increasingly individualistic art world.

---

### 10. **Changing Modes of Production and Education**

Digital tools have transformed workflows: musicians now record remotely and collaborate online.  
Educational models, such as **Philadelphia University’s Strategic Design MBA**, emphasize **integrative thinking, user-centered design, and rapid prototyping**, aligning artistic creativity with innovation and business strategy.

> **Key idea:** The future of artistic practice lies in hybrid education and collaborative infrastructures that merge creativity with entrepreneurial and technological skill.

---

**Summary Insight:**  
Across this literature, the artist’s role evolves from autonomous creator to adaptive, entrepreneurial, and socially engaged worker. They must master uncertainty, synthesize skills across disciplines, and build communities in a system that simultaneously empowers and exploits them.
